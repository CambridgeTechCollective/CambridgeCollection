Package fancyhdr Warning: \headheight is too small (12.0pt): 
(fancyhdr)                Make it at least 25.63757pt, for example:
(fancyhdr)                \setlength{\headheight}{25.63757pt}.
(fancyhdr)                You might also make \topmargin smaller to compensate:

(fancyhdr)                \addtolength{\topmargin}{-13.63757pt}.
