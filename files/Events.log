Package fancyhdr Warning: \headheight is too small (12.0pt): 
(fancyhdr)                Make it at least 25.63757pt, for example:
(fancyhdr)                \setlength{\headheight}{25.63757pt}.
(fancyhdr)                You might also make \topmargin smaller to compensate:

I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is
simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

Package fancyhdr Warning: \headheight is too small (12.0pt): 
(fancyhdr)                Make it at least 25.63757pt, for example:
(fancyhdr)                \setlength{\headheight}{25.63757pt}.
(fancyhdr)                You might also make \topmargin smaller to compensate:

I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark

you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

Package fancyhdr Warning: \headheight is too small (12.0pt): 
(fancyhdr)                Make it at least 25.63757pt, for example:
(fancyhdr)                \setlength{\headheight}{25.63757pt}.
(fancyhdr)                You might also make \topmargin smaller to compensate:

! Misplaced alignment tab character &.

I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is
simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark

you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is

you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.
