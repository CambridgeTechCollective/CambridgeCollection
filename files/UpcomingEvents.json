Our goal is to foster open discussions and promote a sense of belonging and community through respectful dialogues. Storytelling is a powerful tool for addressing social issues, and the Waterloo Region Migration Film Festival serves as an educational platform to influence perceptions and advocate for basic human rights.About the Immigration PartnershipImmigration Partnership is a collaboration of community service, business, municipal, and post-secondary organizations and Waterloo Region residents working together. We work together to create the conditions for immigrants to succeed and help build a welcoming, dynamic community.

Even mainstream literature features the same kinds of stories told by the same voices. It fails to recognize the diversity of voices across Turtle Island. Stories exist and persist in diverse and divergent forms.Mihko Kiskisiwin is collection of Indigenous North American voices, from incarcerated and diversified Indigenous community members, elders, and youth to people with disabilities and 2SLGBTQIA+ people. This anthology by the Indigenous Poets Society (Saskatchewan\u2013Ontario) showcases spoken and written poetry, fiction, and creative non-fiction from emerging and established artists, writers, and performers.Testimony is at the heart of this collection. With vulnerability and urgency, these writers illuminate the complexities of trauma, identity, and healing. By empowering diverse and divergent Indigenous voices, intersectional awareness and diversity flourish.

Lisa Jackson\u2019s portrait of Cree Elder Wilfred Buck moves between earth and sky, past and present, bringing to life ancient teachings of Indigenous astronomy and cosmology to tell a story that spans generations.

A culmination of three years of work and countless stitches, these embroideries, each representing a letter of the alphabet, depict scientific concepts in a creative and accessible way. This exhibition coincides with Wright Vartanian\u2019s book release, Stitching Science: Exploring Science from A to Z, published by Firefly Books in the fall of 2024.Lauren Wright Vartanian is a multidisciplinary artist currently focusing on textile art.

Participate in three small group interactions to expand your knowledge and build understanding with various community members.A Body in Translation by Aashay DalviAashay Dalvi, is an anti-racism consultant for SPECTRUM and founder of Rad Riot Books. They have previously spoken about queer-affirming and anti-colonial literature at the University of Waterloo, the GSA Conference, Tri-Pride, Kitchener Public Library, and more across Waterloo Region.Aashay\u2019s work is guided by the understanding that decolonizing one\u2019s own perspective begins with seeking out and embracing voices that challenge the status quo. Frequently, narratives from queer, racialized, and non-Eurocentric immigrant voices are sidelined or misrepresented in mainstream media, despite providing invaluable insight into the larger colonial systems that perpetuate inequities within our community. Rad Riot Books was started with the purpose of challenging imperialism and settler colonialism by providing a safe space where queer and racialized newcomers as well as curious members of the community could feel empowered to explore these ideas in diverse and anti-racist book selections.From There to Here by Marjorie-Ann KnightMarjorie has a lot of lived experience when it comes to the challenges and consequences of poverty. She has struggled as a member of the working poor, experiencing precarious work while raising a family. She is passionate about advocating for those who struggle due to inadequate income and services. In 2018, Marjorie took her first step into politics and remains active in the Riding of Cambridge for the NDP. She continues to be engaged in her community and is a founding member of Rhythm and Blues Cambridge, working with community partners to create opportunities for our BIR communities. She may be found working as Community Faculty with the Lyle Hallman School of Social Work at Wilfrid Laurier University where she engages with the upcoming social workers in our community. Marjorie currently serves on the boards of The Cambridge Shelter Corp and ACCKWA. She is presently employed as a Family Outreach Worker with the House of Friendship in Cambridge.This is What it Looks Like to Care About Community by Chrissy Hodgins, CEO of Cambridge Public LibraryChrissy Hodgins is the CEO of Cambridge Public Library, arriving in the role in 2023. She loves to hear and learn about others. Sharing and finding connections between people and ideas is the highlight of her day. Admittedly, talking about herself isn\u2019t always easy, but one of her personal values includes being authentic which does mean being brave enough to be vulnerable. Chrissy has called many places home, and they have experienced plenty of challenges and successes; they will look to share stories about themselves that may be relatable by many, by some and by few.Community takes all shapes and forms and people, like this book\u2019s author, can count themselves fortunate when they belong to many. Whether it is family, extended family, friends, workplaces, and anyplace you\u2019ve called home, you have as much to gain from community as you can give. Working in public service at five different public libraries across the country, provided this book with valuable perspective and opportunities. This book will share what public library service looks like at its best, where challenges are encountered and how this intersects between the person and the profession.AccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your needs as soon as possible so arrangements can be organized.

Participate in three small group interactions to expand your knowledge and build understanding with various members of our community.Come Alive - How to self publish and promote your book, by Paul LanganPaul Langan is a Canadian author, historian, community sports volunteer, and founder of the High Speed Rail Canada. Paul has written over 29 booklets, short stories, and books, including, Hespeler's Hidden Secrets, The Three Hotels of Preston, and his latest work, Classic Hockey Stories from Pulps Golden Era. Paul has spent most of his adult life in youth sports organizations. He coached and was convenor for Hespeler Minor Hockey, was a coach for Cambridge Youth Soccer, and the founder and President of Scorpions Youth Volleyball Club.For Paul's many contributions to Cambridge, he has been honoured with the City of Cambridge Sports Contributor of the Year Award, Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal, Rudolph Boost Heritage Award, and the Bernice Adams Legacy Award for the Literary Arts.I Saved Myself by Wasizo kwe Missabie (Woman who Glitters)Cynthia (Wasizo kwe) Missabie is an Oji Cree, author, poet, an Alcoholics Anonymous Leader for over 30 years, and a 60's scoop survivor. Cynthia, along with the Indigenous Poets Society, launched a poetry anthology called Mihko Kiskisiwin-Blood Memory.This is What it Looks Like to Care About Community by Chrissy Hodgins, CEO of Cambridge Public LibraryChrissy Hodgins is the CEO of Cambridge Public Library, arriving in the role in 2023. She loves to hear and learn about others. Sharing and finding connections between people and ideas is the highlight of her day. Admittedly, talking about herself isn\u2019t always easy, but one of her personal values includes being authentic which does mean being brave enough to be vulnerable. Chrissy has called many places home, and they have experienced plenty of challenges and successes; they will look to share stories about themselves that may be relatable by many, by some and by few.Community takes all shapes and forms and people, like this book\u2019s author, can count themselves fortunate when they belong to many. Whether it is family, extended family, friends, workplaces, and anyplace you\u2019ve called home, you have as much to gain from community as you can give. Working in public service at five different public libraries across the country, provided this book with valuable perspective and opportunities. This book will share what public library service looks like at its best, where challenges are encountered and how this intersects between the person and the profession.AccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your needs as soon as possible so arrangements can be organized.
