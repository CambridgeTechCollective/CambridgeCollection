Her work is a tactile fruit salad with a soup\u00e7on of the esoteric. She has exhibited and performed both nationally and internationally and her work has been featured in publications such as: The New York Times, Harper\u2019s Bazaar Japan, Nylon Magazine and Giant Robot Magazine. She was awarded the 2020 Best of Craft and Design Award from the Toronto Outdoor Art Fair.In addition to maintaining her art practice in Guelph, Alisa also acts as a creative mentor and teacher/facilitator via various organizations including Art Not Shame. She unites her entrenchment in pop culture with her unparalleled sewing/sculpture/story-telling skills. She is inspired by other handmade items such as quilts and afghans for her, these items have a feeling of nostalgia and comfort to them. In addition, Alisa often uses recycled materials to lend to the nostalgic feel as well as fit with her philosophy of re-using what she has. https://www.alisamcronald.com/This program is offered in partnership with Spectrum, Waterloo Region\u2019s Rainbow Community Space.AGE GROUP: |\\nCambridge Art Galleries |\\nAdults |EVENT TYPE: |\\nPrograms + Workshops |TAGS: |\\n#Arts |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/8861315", "date": {"start": "2023-10-19T18:00:00Z", "end": "2023-10-19T20:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Queen's Square - Lobby IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-10-15T09:25:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent9098199", "eventName": "Next in Soldering", "description": "Take on a bigger project while learning the basics of soldering.Learn about circuits and soldering by creating a small Bluetooth speaker.All supplies included.Cost: FreeAGE GROUP: |\\nTeens |\\nAdults |EVENT TYPE: |\\nPrograms + Workshops |\\nMaker Programs |TAGS: |\\nTechTraining |\\nTechnology |\\nSoldering |\\nMakerspace |\\nMaker |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/9098199", "date": {"start": "2023-10-19T18:30:00Z", "end": "2023-10-19T20:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Old Post Office - IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-10-15T09:25:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent9117466", "eventName": "MMMMunsch!

It is where residents gather to talk about food and community happenings. It\u2019s where awareness is built and the beginnings of change takes place.The CFM dates back to the 1830s with the current market building holding its seat on Dickson Street since 1887. The presence of the market in conjunction with other civic structures, the Town Halls, is an English tradition that is as relevant today as it was when the market was built.The CFM building\u2019s continued use as a market is unique in Ontario. While other markets either remain outdoors only or have had their original buildings converted for other uses, the CFM has continued to flourish in its original location in its original building for its original intended use and this should be celebrated.As you explore the market, the sweet and spicy aromas of hot prepared foods and snacks will tempt you, along with an extensive selection of cheeses, chutneys, pies, confections, specialty oils, preserves, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.A wide range of local growers and food producers can supply you with all your needs from savoury appetizers to mouth-watering desserts.Our market wouldn\u2019t exist without those dedicated vendors, some of whom have been a part of our team for over 50 years. They arrive in the snow and in the rain, or in the heat of summer, often setting up as early as 3:30 in the morning and many don\u2019t pack up until more than 12 hours later.We have 26 year-round vendors and 30 seasonal vendors, averaging 56 vendors at the peak of the market season, who supply approximately 35,000 shopper visits each year.You can learn more about our vendors by visiting the vendor directory on our website, cambridgefarmersmarket.ca.The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open Saturdays from 7 am to 1 pm, year-round. It is located at\u00a0the corner of Ainslie Street and Dickson Street, in the heart of downtown Cambridge, and parking is available nearby.For more information, visit cambridgefarmersmarket.ca", "sourceURL": "https://calendar.cambridge.ca/default/Detail/2023-10-21-0700-Cambridge-Farmers-Market", "date": {"start": "2023-10-21T07:00:00Z", "end": "2023-10-21T13:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "40 Dickson St,", "address": "40 Dickson St,"}, "organizer": {"name": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "contact": {"email": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "phone": ""}}, "tags": ["CityCam"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-10-15T09:25:00Z", "scraperID": "Cam0002JSON"}, {"eventId": "calendarcambridgecadefaultDetail2023-10-21-0900-Cambridgelicious", "eventName": "Cambridgelicious", "description": "This fall, have a deliciously local experience at the first ever Cambridgelicious, taking place from\u00a0October 13 - 22, 2023.", "sourceURL": "https://calendar.cambridge.ca/default/Detail/2023-10-21-0900-Cambridgelicious", "date": {"start": "2023-10-21T09:00:00Z", "end": "2023-10-21T09:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Various restaurants throughout the City ", "address": "Various restaurants throughout the City "}, "organizer": {"name": " pearcel@cambridge.ca", "contact": {"email": " pearcel@cambridge.ca", "phone": "519-740-4685 ext 4615"}}, "tags": ["CityCam"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-10-15T09:25:00Z", "scraperID": "Cam0002JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent9357164", "eventName": "Reading Rewards, Contests, Missions, and more", "description": "Use your skills to win prizes, solve puzzles, and have fun.

Join historian Dr. Matthew Griffis as he tells the story of Carnegie libraries and how they impacted the development of public libraries in Ontario in the early 20th century. Drawing on years of research, Griffis will explain why Carnegie libraries were built in some locations but not others, why some Carnegie libraries shared architectural similarities while others seemed more unique, and why some Carnegie libraries have survived over a century of service while others have been closed or demolished. The presentation will include many images of library buildings from across Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom.About our SpeakerMatthew Griffis received his PhD in library and information science from Western University in 2013. He specialized in the study of libraries as places, particularly the origins and development of modern library building designs. For over twenty years, Griffis has maintained an interest in the history of Carnegie libraries and an enthusiasm for their preservation.

It is where residents gather to talk about food and community happenings. It\u2019s where awareness is built and the beginnings of change takes place.The CFM dates back to the 1830s with the current market building holding its seat on Dickson Street since 1887. The presence of the market in conjunction with other civic structures, the Town Halls, is an English tradition that is as relevant today as it was when the market was built.The CFM building\u2019s continued use as a market is unique in Ontario. While other markets either remain outdoors only or have had their original buildings converted for other uses, the CFM has continued to flourish in its original location in its original building for its original intended use and this should be celebrated.As you explore the market, the sweet and spicy aromas of hot prepared foods and snacks will tempt you, along with an extensive selection of cheeses, chutneys, pies, confections, specialty oils, preserves, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.A wide range of local growers and food producers can supply you with all your needs from savoury appetizers to mouth-watering desserts.Our market wouldn\u2019t exist without those dedicated vendors, some of whom have been a part of our team for over 50 years. They arrive in the snow and in the rain, or in the heat of summer, often setting up as early as 3:30 in the morning and many don\u2019t pack up until more than 12 hours later.We have 26 year-round vendors and 30 seasonal vendors, averaging 56 vendors at the peak of the market season, who supply approximately 35,000 shopper visits each year.You can learn more about our vendors by visiting the vendor directory on our website, cambridgefarmersmarket.ca.The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open Saturdays from 7 am to 1 pm, year-round. It is located at\u00a0the corner of Ainslie Street and Dickson Street, in the heart of downtown Cambridge, and parking is available nearby.For more information, visit cambridgefarmersmarket.ca", "sourceURL": "https://calendar.cambridge.ca/default/Detail/2023-10-28-0700-Cambridge-Farmers-Market", "date": {"start": "2023-10-28T07:00:00Z", "end": "2023-10-28T13:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "40 Dickson St,", "address": "40 Dickson St,"}, "organizer": {"name": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "contact": {"email": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "phone": ""}}, "tags": ["CityCam"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-10-15T09:25:00Z", "scraperID": "Cam0002JSON"}, {"eventId": "calendarcambridgecadefaultDetail2023-10-28-0830-ECU-a-Division-of-WFCU-Credit-Union-Trick-or-Trot", "eventName": "ECU - a Division of WFCU Credit Union Trick or Trot", "description": "This October, we are proud to host Waterloo Region\u2019s inaugural\u00a0ECU \u2013 a Division of WFCU Credit Union Trick or Trot!\u00a0A Halloween-themed\u00a05K Run, 5K Walk, and 1K or 250m Kids Dash,\u00a0this new community event offers family fun you won\u2019t want to miss!Alongside the 5K Run, 5K Walk, and Kids Dash, we will be hosting a\u00a0Halloween Costume Contest.

It is where residents gather to talk about food and community happenings. It\u2019s where awareness is built and the beginnings of change takes place.The CFM dates back to the 1830s with the current market building holding its seat on Dickson Street since 1887. The presence of the market in conjunction with other civic structures, the Town Halls, is an English tradition that is as relevant today as it was when the market was built.The CFM building\u2019s continued use as a market is unique in Ontario. While other markets either remain outdoors only or have had their original buildings converted for other uses, the CFM has continued to flourish in its original location in its original building for its original intended use and this should be celebrated.As you explore the market, the sweet and spicy aromas of hot prepared foods and snacks will tempt you, along with an extensive selection of cheeses, chutneys, pies, confections, specialty oils, preserves, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.A wide range of local growers and food producers can supply you with all your needs from savoury appetizers to mouth-watering desserts.Our market wouldn\u2019t exist without those dedicated vendors, some of whom have been a part of our team for over 50 years. They arrive in the snow and in the rain, or in the heat of summer, often setting up as early as 3:30 in the morning and many don\u2019t pack up until more than 12 hours later.We have 26 year-round vendors and 30 seasonal vendors, averaging 56 vendors at the peak of the market season, who supply approximately 35,000 shopper visits each year.You can learn more about our vendors by visiting the vendor directory on our website, cambridgefarmersmarket.ca.The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open Saturdays from 7 am to 1 pm, year-round.

In this talk, we will discuss the background of these women, why they fell under Hitler\u2019s spell, how they helped further his career, and the price that they paid for being an intimate of Hitler.About Prof. Gary BruceProf. Bruce is currently developing two research projects. The first project seeks to return historical focus to the early years of the Nazi regime through an examination of violence meted out by the state, and the manner by which the German populace responded to state-sanctioned murder prior to the Holocaust. The second project deals with memory and memorialization of the Nazi era as exhibited in historic sites in and around Berlin, with a focus on the Ravensbr\u00fcck memorial site.

When the terrible war ended on 11 November, 1918, Canadian's were confronted with marking the sacrifice of the 620,000 who served, and the 66,000 who were killed. Grappling with the meaning of the war, Canadian's built memorials across the country, created new symbols of commemoration, and forged new events like Armistice Day (later renamed Remembrance Day). Dr. Cook will use the Great War as a means to better understand the ways that Canadian's have faced mass death and loss in war, and how they continue to reflect on the Great War\u2019s place in the country\u2019s social memory.Registration requiredLimited entry may be available at the doorCost: FreeAGE GROUP: |\\nAdults |EVENT TYPE: |\\nPrograms + Workshops |TAGS: |\\nRememberanceDay |\\nHeritage |\\nAuthors |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/9148783", "date": {"start": "2023-11-09T19:00:00Z", "end": "2023-11-09T20:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Old Post Office - Riverview Room IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-10-15T09:25:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent9087940", "eventName": "Outerwhere", "description": "September 30 to December 17, 2023Outerwhere is one of two exhibitions featuring the work of contemporary Canadian artist, Meera Sethi.Sethi's exhibition Cotton Exchange is on view at our Preston gallery.Explore OuterwhereAbout the Artist: Meera Sethi is a contemporary Canadian visual artist with an interdisciplinary, intuitive, and research-based practice that moves between painting, drawing, fibre, photography, illustration, performance, and social practice.AGE GROUP: |\\nCambridge Art Galleries |EVENT TYPE: |\\nExhibitions + Openings |TAGS: |\\nExhbitions |\\nArts |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/9087940", "date": {"start": "2023-11-10T00:00:00Z", "end": "2023-11-10T23:59:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Queen's Square - IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-10-15T09:25:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent9090923", "eventName": "Cotton Exchange", "description": "September 30 to November 26, 2023Cotton Exchange is one of two exhibitions featuring the work of contemporary Canadian artist, Meera Sethi.Sethi's exhibition Outerwhere is on view at our Queen's Square gallery.Explore Cotton ExchangeAbout the Artist: Meera Sethi is a contemporary Canadian visual artist with an interdisciplinary, intuitive, and research-based practice that moves between painting, drawing, fibre, photography, illustration, performance, and social practice.AGE GROUP: |\\nCambridge Art Galleries |EVENT TYPE: |\\nExhibitions + Openings |TAGS: |\\nExhibitions |\\nArts |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/9090923", "date": {"start": "2023-11-10T00:00:00Z", "end": "2023-11-10T23:59:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Preston - IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-10-15T09:25:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent9074617", "eventName": "Library Settlement Program", "description": "As a primary settlement agency in Cambridge, YMCA Immigrant Services acts as a \u201cfirst stop\u201d for newcomersThrough the YMCA Library Settlement Partnerships (LSP), our Settlement Workers are located within the libraries to continue to support newcomer and immigrant needs.

It is where residents gather to talk about food and community happenings. It\u2019s where awareness is built and the beginnings of change takes place.The CFM dates back to the 1830s with the current market building holding its seat on Dickson Street since 1887. The presence of the market in conjunction with other civic structures, the Town Halls, is an English tradition that is as relevant today as it was when the market was built.The CFM building\u2019s continued use as a market is unique in Ontario. While other markets either remain outdoors only or have had their original buildings converted for other uses, the CFM has continued to flourish in its original location in its original building for its original intended use and this should be celebrated.As you explore the market, the sweet and spicy aromas of hot prepared foods and snacks will tempt you, along with an extensive selection of cheeses, chutneys, pies, confections, specialty oils, preserves, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.A wide range of local growers and food producers can supply you with all your needs from savoury appetizers to mouth-watering desserts.Our market wouldn\u2019t exist without those dedicated vendors, some of whom have been a part of our team for over 50 years. They arrive in the snow and in the rain, or in the heat of summer, often setting up as early as 3:30 in the morning and many don\u2019t pack up until more than 12 hours later.We have 26 year-round vendors and 30 seasonal vendors, averaging 56 vendors at the peak of the market season, who supply approximately 35,000 shopper visits each year.You can learn more about our vendors by visiting the vendor directory on our website, cambridgefarmersmarket.ca.The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open Saturdays from 7 am to 1 pm, year-round. It is located at\u00a0the corner of Ainslie Street and Dickson Street, in the heart of downtown Cambridge, and parking is available nearby.For more information, visit cambridgefarmersmarket.ca", "sourceURL": "https://calendar.cambridge.ca/default/Detail/2023-11-11-0700-Cambridge-Farmers-Market", "date": {"start": "2023-11-11T07:00:00Z", "end": "2023-11-11T13:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "40 Dickson St,", "address": "40 Dickson St,"}, "organizer": {"name": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "contact": {"email": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "phone": ""}}, "tags": ["CityCam"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-10-15T09:25:00Z", "scraperID": "Cam0002JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent9343336", "eventName": "Time of Remembrance", "description": "Lest We ForgetAt the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, together, we observe a moment of silence to mark the sacrifice of the many who have fallen in the service of their country and to acknowledge the courage of those who continue to serve.Timeline9:30 am Wartime music played on the piano10:00 am Galt Legion Ceremony at the Galt War Memorial11:00 am Moment of Silence11:15 am Wartime vocal and piano concertLight refreshments will be available while supply allows.AGE GROUP: |\\nAdults |EVENT TYPE: |\\nSpecial Events |\\nLive Performances |TAGS: |\\nTime of Remembrance |\\nRemembrance |\\nRememberanceDay |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/9343336", "date": {"start": "2023-11-11T10:00:00Z", "end": "2023-11-11T12:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Queen's Square - Lobby IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-10-15T09:25:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent9114575", "eventName": "Digital Embroidery Design 101", "description": "Learn about monogramming, digitizing logos, and embroidering text.Designing your own custom embroidery using the machine can only take you so far.
