A culmination of three years of work and countless stitches, these embroideries, each representing a letter of the alphabet, depict scientific concepts in a creative and accessible way. This exhibition coincides with Wright Vartanian\u2019s book release, Stitching Science: Exploring Science from A to Z, published by Firefly Books in the fall of 2024.Lauren Wright Vartanian is a multidisciplinary artist currently focusing on textile art. She has a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Drawing and Painting from OCAD University, where she graduated in 2006. She has been creating and selling art under the name Neurons and Nebulas since 2016. Her work blends art and science in a way that is fun and educational, but also beautiful and inviting.
