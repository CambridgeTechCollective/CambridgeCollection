Through creative programming, Art + Wellness workshops foster belonging, combats social isolation, and demonstrates the transformative power of art in supporting well-being. In each Art + Wellness session, we welcome a different wellness practitioner, counsellor, or art therapist who guides participants through a series of activities and exercises to focus on mental health, well-being, and connection.This month we are pleased to welcome back Ali Burke for a wellness-inspired interactive art based activity called 'Mapping our Nervous System.' In this interactive and arts-based workshop, participants will be guided to explore and create a visual map of their own unique nervous system.\u00a0 Grounded in the idea that each of our nervous systems naturally has different states, the workshops will offer participants both education about how these states are commonly understood, as well as an opportunity to create a piece of art illustrating their own relationship to and experience of these states.\u00a0The themes of awareness building, self-compassion, and agency will be central as we explore what brings us a sense of safety in our nervous systems.About the Instructor: Ali Burke is a Registered Social Worker and Psychotherapist with over 14 years experience, she currently has a private practice in Cambridge, Ontario. Her work is grounded in the theories of Narrative Therapy, which sees people as having many skills, competencies, beliefs, values, commitments and abilities that will assist them to change their relationship with problems in their lives. She integrates mindfulness, cognitive behavioural therapy, and emotion focused therapy into her work.This series is part of the larger Art + Wellness Project, made possible by the generous support of the Community Fund, the Marion Woeller Community Arts Fund, The Anonymous Fund, and the Keith and Winifred Shantz Fund for the Arts, held by the Waterloo Region Community Foundation.Presented by CAGE:AccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your needs as soon as possible so arrangements can be organized.

A culmination of three years of work and countless stitches, these embroideries, each representing a letter of the alphabet, depict scientific concepts in a creative and accessible way. This exhibition coincides with Wright Vartanian\u2019s book release, Stitching Science: Exploring Science from A to Z, published by Firefly Books in the fall of 2024.Lauren Wright Vartanian is a multidisciplinary artist currently focusing on textile art. She has a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Drawing and Painting from OCAD University, where she graduated in 2006. She has been creating and selling art under the name Neurons and Nebulas since 2016.
