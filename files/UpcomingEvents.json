She earned her MSc and PhD in Astronomy, Planetary Science, and Exploration from Western University. During her graduate studies, she researched young, massive stars and the disks surrounding them using both observational data and computer modeling. These disks of dust and gas are a hub for planet formation, so studying the disks allows us to understand how stars and planets form. Post-PhD, she transitioned into the field of science communication and education. Parshati is a sought-after storyteller, and for over a decade, she has shared her passion for space, fostering awareness among the public, particularly youth.

On the back cover of the book June writes, \u201cI promise although this journey has no roadmap, there are those who can help. Sometimes I believe that there is an invisible silver thread that joins mothers that have lost children. We meet in the most usual places. When we meet, we know.\u201dThree years in the making, Letters from the Club is a collection of heart-wrenching stories, and has been described as a lifeline for mothers that mourn the loss of a child. In this beautiful anthology, 32 mothers talk about their devastating experience of loss, presented through individual letters to another mother. After reading the book, a grieving mother said, \u201cI laughed and I cried, but it reminded me that this is an experience that other mothers have survived. Maybe, just maybe, I can survive.\u201dThis is a book of stories that offers both courage and comfort while still presenting the overwhelming power of this loss.Erin Davis, grieving mother, podcaster, and author of the national bestseller Mourning Has Broken, wrote in the foreword of Letters from the Club, \u201cBe gentle with yourself: take the time to wrap yourself in each cherished memory. I am grateful to be reminded not only that we can survive the worst tragedy a parent may experience, but also that we need to tell our stories and share our grief.\u201dLight refreshments will be provided.Books will be available for purchase at the event from the book curator for $20.00 cash or e-transfer.AccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your needs as soon as possible so arrangements can be organized.

My first experiences with wetlands came early in life growing up on a farm near Point Pelee National Park and working in the Visitor Centre at the park for many summers. My love of these environments evolved over the years into a deeper concern for loss of these habitats and all that they support. Wetlands are unique places with environmental, spiritual, health, cultural, and social significance. They are rich biodiverse environments that team with life and provide an ever changing and evolving source of beauty. In these times of water and climate crisis, they play a major role in water filtration, flood mitigation, soil stabilization, nutrient cycling, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration and habitat for a diverse range of species, and plants (including medicinal and food sources).Explore: ShallowsAGE GROUP: |\\nCambridge Art Galleries |EVENT TYPE: |\\nExhibitions + Openings |TAGS: |\\nExhibitions |\\n#Arts |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/10327476", "date": {"start": "2024-05-11T00:00:00Z", "end": "2024-05-11T23:59:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Queen's Square - Gallery IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2024-04-27T07:44:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "calendarcambridgecadefaultDetail2024-05-11-0700-Cambridge-Farmers-Market", "eventName": "Cambridge Farmers' Market", "description": "The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open year round 7am-1pm.We have something for everyone!

All are welcome and always free. Light snacks and refreshments will be served.Shallows\u00a0is an exhibition that represents my current focus on imagery derived from wetland habitats. My first experiences with wetlands came early in life growing up on a farm near Point Pelee National Park and working in the Visitor Centre at the park for many summers. My love of these environments evolved over the years into a deeper concern for loss of these habitats and all that they support. Wetlands are unique places with environmental, spiritual, health, cultural, and social significance. They are rich biodiverse environments that team with life and provide an ever changing and evolving source of beauty. In these times of water and climate crisis, they play a major role in water filtration, flood mitigation, soil stabilization, nutrient cycling, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration and habitat for a diverse range of species, and plants (including medicinal and food sources).I research concepts and imagery for my work through environmental readings, on-site drawing, underwater photography, sound recordings in wetland areas and through discussions with environmentally minded people. I am very grateful for artist friends such as Briana Palmer who helped to expand my print practice and my ideas of environmentally responsible approaches to art. I am also appreciative of McMaster University connections in biology, hydrology, English and Cultural Studies, and many other disciplines that have informed and deepened my commitment to environmental concerns.My studio practice embraces a poetic approach. The translucent flowing layers of fabric and play of light suggest a fluid ambiguous space that acts as a visual metaphor for water. Printed, collaged, and sewn additions reference plants and amphibians from local marshes either directly or in abstract ways. The large-scale work entitled\u00a0Reflections\u00a0includes a frog chorus sound component recorded in a Bruce Peninsula wetland providing a more immersive, sensory experience.This body of work incorporates fabric and sewing practices celebrating tactile material engagement and a return to attentive process. I am attracted to the slow pace of fibre-based work that is process oriented, measured, gentle and purposeful. Fabrics and sewing invite associations with concepts of mending, healing, and transformation, to reinforce ideas repair.\u00a0References to patching and the piecing together of fragments welcomes ideas of connection and renewal that are coupled with wetland imagery to suggest preservation, restoration, and celebration of these important habitats. There has been a wealth of scientific data on environmental concerns throughout my lifetime with many different strategies for raising awareness. The message here is not saturated with scientific data, nor does it prescribe any specific environmental action. It presents a quiet, visual experience intended to envelop the viewer in a space conducive to personal reflection, and caring about a habitat that is rapidly and quietly disappearing, despite its significance to our own survival.Judy Major-Girardin\u00a0received a BFA from the University of Windsor and an MFA from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. She is Professor Emerita from the School of the Arts at McMaster University where she taught for thirty-nine years.\u00a0 She lives in Cambridge Ontario and has served as Co-Chair of the Cambridge Sculpture Garden since 2005. Her studio work includes an integrated practise of painting, printmaking, drawing, artist books, and hanging fiber-based works that raise awareness for the preservation and celebration of wetland environments. Employing environmentally responsible studio practices is central to her work. Judy has exhibited in Canada, USA, and internationally and has attended artist residencies in British Columbia, Newfoundland, Quebec, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Alabama, Portugal, New Zealand, and most recently in France.", "sourceURL": "https://calendar.cambridge.ca/default/Detail/2024-05-11-1300-Exhibition-Opening-Shallows-by-Judy-Major-Girardin", "date": {"start": "2024-05-11T13:00:00Z", "end": "2024-05-11T16:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Idea Exchange: 1 North Square, Cambridge, ON N1S 2K6                        ", "address": "Idea Exchange: 1 North Square, Cambridge, ON N1S 2K6                        "}, "organizer": {"name": " avoz@ideaexchange.org", "contact": {"email": " avoz@ideaexchange.org", "phone": "519-621-0460 x129"}}, "tags": ["CityCam"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2024-04-27T07:44:00Z", "scraperID": "Cam0002JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent10265791", "eventName": "Queer Craft Circle: Flat Felt", "description": "LGBTQ2S+ identifying individuals are invited to explore a different creative project each month in a fun and safe space.Join us for this fun, casual program.

My love of these environments evolved over the years into a deeper concern for loss of these habitats and all that they support. Wetlands are unique places with environmental, spiritual, health, cultural, and social significance. They are rich biodiverse environments that team with life and provide an ever changing and evolving source of beauty.

My first experiences with wetlands came early in life growing up on a farm near Point Pelee National Park and working in the Visitor Centre at the park for many summers. My love of these environments evolved over the years into a deeper concern for loss of these habitats and all that they support. Wetlands are unique places with environmental, spiritual, health, cultural, and social significance. They are rich biodiverse environments that team with life and provide an ever changing and evolving source of beauty. In these times of water and climate crisis, they play a major role in water filtration, flood mitigation, soil stabilization, nutrient cycling, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration and habitat for a diverse range of species, and plants (including medicinal and food sources).Explore: ShallowsAGE GROUP: |\\nCambridge Art Galleries |EVENT TYPE: |\\nExhibitions + Openings |TAGS: |\\nExhibitions |\\n#Arts |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/10327480", "date": {"start": "2024-05-15T00:00:00Z", "end": "2024-05-15T23:59:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Queen's Square - Gallery IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2024-04-27T07:44:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent10265175", "eventName": "Sensory Tales", "description": "All the senses are celebrated in this inclusive sensory experience.Join us for an immersive\u00a0sensory\u00a0story time filled with adventure.AccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your needs as soon as possible so arrangements can be organized.

My love of these environments evolved over the years into a deeper concern for loss of these habitats and all that they support. Wetlands are unique places with environmental, spiritual, health, cultural, and social significance. They are rich biodiverse environments that team with life and provide an ever changing and evolving source of beauty. In these times of water and climate crisis, they play a major role in water filtration, flood mitigation, soil stabilization, nutrient cycling, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration and habitat for a diverse range of species, and plants (including medicinal and food sources).Explore: ShallowsAGE GROUP: |\\nCambridge Art Galleries |EVENT TYPE: |\\nExhibitions + Openings |TAGS: |\\nExhibitions |\\n#Arts |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/10327481", "date": {"start": "2024-05-16T00:00:00Z", "end": "2024-05-16T23:59:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Queen's Square - Gallery IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2024-04-27T07:44:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent10252035", "eventName": "Time for Twos and Threes", "description": "Bring your tot for some late-morning fun.

My first experiences with wetlands came early in life growing up on a farm near Point Pelee National Park and working in the Visitor Centre at the park for many summers. My love of these environments evolved over the years into a deeper concern for loss of these habitats and all that they support. Wetlands are unique places with environmental, spiritual, health, cultural, and social significance. They are rich biodiverse environments that team with life and provide an ever changing and evolving source of beauty. In these times of water and climate crisis, they play a major role in water filtration, flood mitigation, soil stabilization, nutrient cycling, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration and habitat for a diverse range of species, and plants (including medicinal and food sources).Explore: ShallowsAGE GROUP: |\\nCambridge Art Galleries |EVENT TYPE: |\\nExhibitions + Openings |TAGS: |\\nExhibitions |\\n#Arts |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/10327485", "date": {"start": "2024-05-22T00:00:00Z", "end": "2024-05-22T23:59:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Queen's Square - Gallery IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2024-04-27T07:44:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent10265176", "eventName": "Sensory Tales", "description": "All the senses are celebrated in this inclusive sensory experience.Join us for an immersive\u00a0sensory\u00a0story time filled with adventure.AccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your needs as soon as possible so arrangements can be organized.

My first experiences with wetlands came early in life growing up on a farm near Point Pelee National Park and working in the Visitor Centre at the park for many summers.

They are rich biodiverse environments that team with life and provide an ever changing and evolving source of beauty. In these times of water and climate crisis, they play a major role in water filtration, flood mitigation, soil stabilization, nutrient cycling, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration and habitat for a diverse range of species, and plants (including medicinal and food sources).Explore: ShallowsAGE GROUP: |\\nCambridge Art Galleries |EVENT TYPE: |\\nExhibitions + Openings |TAGS: |\\nExhibitions |\\n#Arts |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/10327486", "date": {"start": "2024-05-23T00:00:00Z", "end": "2024-05-23T23:59:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Queen's Square - Gallery IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2024-04-27T07:44:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent10252036", "eventName": "Time for Twos and Threes", "description": "Bring your tot for some late-morning fun.

In these times of water and climate crisis, they play a major role in water filtration, flood mitigation, soil stabilization, nutrient cycling, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration and habitat for a diverse range of species, and plants (including medicinal and food sources).Explore: ShallowsAGE GROUP: |\\nCambridge Art Galleries |EVENT TYPE: |\\nExhibitions + Openings |TAGS: |\\nExhibitions |\\n#Arts |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/10327488", "date": {"start": "2024-05-25T00:00:00Z", "end": "2024-05-25T23:59:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Queen's Square - Gallery IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2024-04-27T07:44:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "calendarcambridgecadefaultDetail2024-05-25-0700-Cambridge-Farmers-Market", "eventName": "Cambridge Farmers' Market", "description": "The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open year round 7am-1pm.We have something for everyone!
