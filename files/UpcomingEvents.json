It is where residents gather to talk about food and community happenings. It\u2019s where awareness is built and the beginnings of change takes place.The CFM dates back to the 1830s with the current market building holding its seat on Dickson Street since 1887. The presence of the market in conjunction with other civic structures, the Town Halls, is an English tradition that is as relevant today as it was when the market was built.The CFM building\u2019s continued use as a market is unique in Ontario. While other markets either remain outdoors only or have had their original buildings converted for other uses, the CFM has continued to flourish in its original location in its original building for its original intended use and this should be celebrated.As you explore the market, the sweet and spicy aromas of hot prepared foods and snacks will tempt you, along with an extensive selection of cheeses, chutneys, pies, confections, specialty oils, preserves, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.A wide range of local growers and food producers can supply you with all your needs from savoury appetizers to mouth-watering desserts.Our market wouldn\u2019t exist without those dedicated vendors, some of whom have been a part of our team for over 50 years. They arrive in the snow and in the rain, or in the heat of summer, often setting up as early as 3:30 in the morning and many don\u2019t pack up until more than 12 hours later.We have 26 year-round vendors and 30 seasonal vendors, averaging 56 vendors at the peak of the market season, who supply approximately 35,000 shopper visits each year.You can learn more about our vendors by visiting the vendor directory on our website, cambridgefarmersmarket.ca.The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open Saturdays from 7 am to 1 pm, year-round. It is located at\u00a0the corner of Ainslie Street and Dickson Street, in the heart of downtown Cambridge, and parking is available nearby.For more information, visit cambridgefarmersmarket.ca", "sourceURL": "https://calendar.cambridge.ca/default/Detail/2023-11-04-0700-Cambridge-Farmers-Market", "date": {"start": "2023-11-04T07:00:00Z", "end": "2023-11-04T13:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "40 Dickson St,", "address": "40 Dickson St,"}, "organizer": {"name": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "contact": {"email": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "phone": ""}}, "tags": ["CityCam"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-11-03T21:56:00Z", "scraperID": "Cam0002JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent8867348", "eventName": "Creating with Flowers", "description": "Make beautiful art using flowers in this fun workshop.Learn how to use flowers in various ways to make creative artworks.

We are most familiar with three of them: his mother, Klara; his niece, Geli; and his long-time girlfriend, Eva, but there were many others who played a significant role in Hitler\u2019s life. In this talk, we will discuss the background of these women, why they fell under Hitler\u2019s spell, how they helped further his career, and the price that they paid for being an intimate of Hitler.About Prof. Gary BruceProf. Bruce is currently developing two research projects. The first project seeks to return historical focus to the early years of the Nazi regime through an examination of violence meted out by the state, and the manner by which the German populace responded to state-sanctioned murder prior to the Holocaust. The second project deals with memory and memorialization of the Nazi era as exhibited in historic sites in and around Berlin, with a focus on the Ravensbr\u00fcck memorial site.

When the terrible war ended on 11 November 1918, Canadians were confronted with marking the sacrifice of the 620,000 who served, and the 66,000 who were killed. Grappling with the meaning of the war, Canadians built memorials across the country, created new symbols of commemoration, and forged new events like Armistice Day (later renamed Remembrance Day). Dr. Cook will use the Great War as a means to better understand the ways that Canadian's have faced mass death and loss in war, and how they continue to reflect on the Great War\u2019s place in the country\u2019s social memory.Registration is required to confirm attendance.

It is where residents gather to talk about food and community happenings. It\u2019s where awareness is built and the beginnings of change takes place.The CFM dates back to the 1830s with the current market building holding its seat on Dickson Street since 1887. The presence of the market in conjunction with other civic structures, the Town Halls, is an English tradition that is as relevant today as it was when the market was built.The CFM building\u2019s continued use as a market is unique in Ontario. While other markets either remain outdoors only or have had their original buildings converted for other uses, the CFM has continued to flourish in its original location in its original building for its original intended use and this should be celebrated.As you explore the market, the sweet and spicy aromas of hot prepared foods and snacks will tempt you, along with an extensive selection of cheeses, chutneys, pies, confections, specialty oils, preserves, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.A wide range of local growers and food producers can supply you with all your needs from savoury appetizers to mouth-watering desserts.Our market wouldn\u2019t exist without those dedicated vendors, some of whom have been a part of our team for over 50 years. They arrive in the snow and in the rain, or in the heat of summer, often setting up as early as 3:30 in the morning and many don\u2019t pack up until more than 12 hours later.We have 26 year-round vendors and 30 seasonal vendors, averaging 56 vendors at the peak of the market season, who supply approximately 35,000 shopper visits each year.You can learn more about our vendors by visiting the vendor directory on our website, cambridgefarmersmarket.ca.The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open Saturdays from 7 am to 1 pm, year-round.

It is where residents gather to talk about food and community happenings. It\u2019s where awareness is built and the beginnings of change takes place.The CFM dates back to the 1830s with the current market building holding its seat on Dickson Street since 1887. The presence of the market in conjunction with other civic structures, the Town Halls, is an English tradition that is as relevant today as it was when the market was built.The CFM building\u2019s continued use as a market is unique in Ontario. While other markets either remain outdoors only or have had their original buildings converted for other uses, the CFM has continued to flourish in its original location in its original building for its original intended use and this should be celebrated.As you explore the market, the sweet and spicy aromas of hot prepared foods and snacks will tempt you, along with an extensive selection of cheeses, chutneys, pies, confections, specialty oils, preserves, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.A wide range of local growers and food producers can supply you with all your needs from savoury appetizers to mouth-watering desserts.Our market wouldn\u2019t exist without those dedicated vendors, some of whom have been a part of our team for over 50 years. They arrive in the snow and in the rain, or in the heat of summer, often setting up as early as 3:30 in the morning and many don\u2019t pack up until more than 12 hours later.We have 26 year-round vendors and 30 seasonal vendors, averaging 56 vendors at the peak of the market season, who supply approximately 35,000 shopper visits each year.You can learn more about our vendors by visiting the vendor directory on our website, cambridgefarmersmarket.ca.The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open Saturdays from 7 am to 1 pm, year-round. It is located at\u00a0the corner of Ainslie Street and Dickson Street, in the heart of downtown Cambridge, and parking is available nearby.For more information, visit cambridgefarmersmarket.ca", "sourceURL": "https://calendar.cambridge.ca/default/Detail/2023-11-18-0700-Cambridge-Farmers-Market", "date": {"start": "2023-11-18T07:00:00Z", "end": "2023-11-18T13:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "40 Dickson St,", "address": "40 Dickson St,"}, "organizer": {"name": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "contact": {"email": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "phone": ""}}, "tags": ["CityCam"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-11-03T21:56:00Z", "scraperID": "Cam0002JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent8867291", "eventName": "Visible Mending", "description": "Visible Mending is guaranteed to liven up your wardrobe!Local mending enthusiast Elysha will guide you through the basics of garment repair.

Her work sits at the intersection of the subjugated body and histories of cloth with a particular focus on South Asia and it\u2019s diasporas. She is interested in the making, wearing, and disposing of cloth; clothing as a form of self-expression and resistance; and the ways by which textile is constituted over vast geographies. Through her work, she delves deep into our understanding of the self, the body, cloth and clothing, including it\u2019s histories, resonances, and possibilities. Her work has been exhibited nationally and internationally and can be found in the permanent collection of the Royal Ontario Museum and the Wedge Collection. She lives and works in the traditional territory of the Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee, Huron-Wendat, and Mississaugas of the Credit River. Her exhibitions Cotton Exchange and Outerwhere are currently on view at Cambridge Art Galleries.Dr Natasha Bissonauth teaches Visual Art and Art History at York University (Toronto). Prior to York University she was Assistant Professor of Women\u2019s Gender, and Sexuality Studies at the College of Wooster. She received her Ph.D. in Art History at Cornell University and her research centers queer, trans, and feminist contemporary art practices with expertise in South Asia and its multiple diasporas. Recent research interests expand on indenture studies, archival work, and material cultures.

It is where residents gather to talk about food and community happenings. It\u2019s where awareness is built and the beginnings of change takes place.The CFM dates back to the 1830s with the current market building holding its seat on Dickson Street since 1887. The presence of the market in conjunction with other civic structures, the Town Halls, is an English tradition that is as relevant today as it was when the market was built.The CFM building\u2019s continued use as a market is unique in Ontario. While other markets either remain outdoors only or have had their original buildings converted for other uses, the CFM has continued to flourish in its original location in its original building for its original intended use and this should be celebrated.As you explore the market, the sweet and spicy aromas of hot prepared foods and snacks will tempt you, along with an extensive selection of cheeses, chutneys, pies, confections, specialty oils, preserves, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.A wide range of local growers and food producers can supply you with all your needs from savoury appetizers to mouth-watering desserts.Our market wouldn\u2019t exist without those dedicated vendors, some of whom have been a part of our team for over 50 years. They arrive in the snow and in the rain, or in the heat of summer, often setting up as early as 3:30 in the morning and many don\u2019t pack up until more than 12 hours later.We have 26 year-round vendors and 30 seasonal vendors, averaging 56 vendors at the peak of the market season, who supply approximately 35,000 shopper visits each year.You can learn more about our vendors by visiting the vendor directory on our website, cambridgefarmersmarket.ca.The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open Saturdays from 7 am to 1 pm, year-round.

It is where residents gather to talk about food and community happenings. It\u2019s where awareness is built and the beginnings of change takes place.The CFM dates back to the 1830s with the current market building holding its seat on Dickson Street since 1887. The presence of the market in conjunction with other civic structures, the Town Halls, is an English tradition that is as relevant today as it was when the market was built.The CFM building\u2019s continued use as a market is unique in Ontario. While other markets either remain outdoors only or have had their original buildings converted for other uses, the CFM has continued to flourish in its original location in its original building for its original intended use and this should be celebrated.As you explore the market, the sweet and spicy aromas of hot prepared foods and snacks will tempt you, along with an extensive selection of cheeses, chutneys, pies, confections, specialty oils, preserves, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.A wide range of local growers and food producers can supply you with all your needs from savoury appetizers to mouth-watering desserts.Our market wouldn\u2019t exist without those dedicated vendors, some of whom have been a part of our team for over 50 years. They arrive in the snow and in the rain, or in the heat of summer, often setting up as early as 3:30 in the morning and many don\u2019t pack up until more than 12 hours later.We have 26 year-round vendors and 30 seasonal vendors, averaging 56 vendors at the peak of the market season, who supply approximately 35,000 shopper visits each year.You can learn more about our vendors by visiting the vendor directory on our website, cambridgefarmersmarket.ca.The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open Saturdays from 7 am to 1 pm, year-round. It is located at\u00a0the corner of Ainslie Street and Dickson Street, in the heart of downtown Cambridge, and parking is available nearby.For more information, visit cambridgefarmersmarket.ca", "sourceURL": "https://calendar.cambridge.ca/default/Detail/2023-12-02-0700-Cambridge-Farmers-Market", "date": {"start": "2023-12-02T07:00:00Z", "end": "2023-12-02T13:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "40 Dickson St,", "address": "40 Dickson St,"}, "organizer": {"name": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "contact": {"email": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "phone": ""}}, "tags": ["CityCam"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-11-03T21:56:00Z", "scraperID": "Cam0002JSON"}, {"eventId": "calendarwaterlooregionmuseumcaDefaultDetail2023-12-02-0830-Pancake-Breakfast-with-Santa", "eventName": "Pancake Breakfast with Santa", "description": "Ho Ho Ho!
