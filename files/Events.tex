September 12, 2024 - January 17, 2025Visit the lobby at Idea Exchange Queen's Square to experience an installation featuring a vibrant collection of items draping the doorway. The installation encourages a moment of pause to wonder and search as the work inspires critiques of consumerism. Torres’ installation uses familiar domestic, institutional, and recreational items to elevate our appreciation of the everyday while also inviting reflection on the challenges of consumer culture—our tendency to accumulate and the growing complexities of storing, recycling, and disposing of surplus goods.This installation reuses the items from Material Culture, an exhibition produced by the University of Waterloo Art Gallery. They generously allowed us to give the items another life before donating them to consumer distribution.Explore: José Luis Torres: A Site-Specific InstallationAccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your

The number and the combination of short and long ‘beeps’ will signify a letter.

Learning Morse code is a great way to challenge your mind and keep it sharp.Amateur Radio (ham radio) is a popular hobby and service that brings people, electronics, and communication together.

September 12, 2024 - January 17, 2025Visit the lobby at Idea Exchange Queen's Square to experience an installation featuring a vibrant collection of items draping the doorway. The installation encourages a moment of pause to wonder and search as the work inspires critiques of consumerism. Torres’ installation uses familiar domestic, institutional, and recreational items to elevate our appreciation of the everyday while also inviting reflection on the challenges of consumer culture—our tendency to accumulate and the growing complexities of storing, recycling, and disposing of surplus goods.This installation reuses the items from Material Culture, an exhibition produced by the University of Waterloo Art Gallery. They generously allowed us to give the items another life before donating them to consumer distribution.Explore: José Luis Torres: A Site-Specific InstallationAccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your
