September 12, 2024 - January 17, 2025Visit the lobby at Idea Exchange Queen's Square to experience an installation featuring a vibrant collection of items draping the doorway. The installation encourages a moment of pause to wonder and search as the work inspires critiques of consumerism. Torres’ installation uses familiar domestic, institutional, and recreational items to elevate our appreciation of the everyday while also inviting reflection on the challenges of consumer culture—our tendency to accumulate and the growing complexities of storing, recycling, and disposing of surplus goods.This installation reuses the items from Material Culture, an exhibition produced by the University of Waterloo Art Gallery. They generously allowed us to give the items another life before donating them to consumer distribution.Explore: José Luis Torres: A Site-Specific InstallationAccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your

I Just Gotta Be Me: Authenticity and Canadian Politics.Scripted politicians sticking to carefully crafted messages has long been a part of politics in Canada. In other words, communications discipline now goes hand-in-hand with party discipline.

What do our Members of Parliament think about their own authenticity when it comes to their roles as elected representatives? What limitations does authenticity face in a parliamentary context like Canada’s? This lecture will provide some preliminary insights into the role of authenticity in Canadian politics.About the PresenterAnna Esselment is an Associate Professor of Political Science and the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies in the Faculty of Arts at the University of Waterloo.

September 12, 2024 - January 17, 2025Visit the lobby at Idea Exchange Queen's Square to experience an installation featuring a vibrant collection of items draping the doorway. The installation encourages a moment of pause to wonder and search as the work inspires critiques of consumerism. Torres’ installation uses familiar domestic, institutional, and recreational items to elevate our appreciation of the everyday while also inviting reflection on the challenges of consumer culture—our tendency to accumulate and the growing complexities of storing, recycling, and disposing of surplus goods.This installation reuses the items from Material Culture, an exhibition produced by the University of Waterloo Art Gallery. They generously allowed us to give the items another life before donating them to consumer distribution.Explore: José Luis Torres: A Site-Specific InstallationAccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your
