November 30, 2024 - February 23, 2025Curated by Karly BoileauWith a focus on a slow-making process through a Japanese heritage craft practice, Hitoko Okada’s major solo exhibition explores new ceramic and textile works that critically engage with and question the global fashion supply chain as it relates to colonial histories of fast fashion. Her works draw inspiration from geological processes and metabolic evolution of fungi, to apply ancestral knowledge in a present-day context to re-imagine futurisms and ways of being through a queer lens.Explore Setsubun - sacred offerings to the divine divideAccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your needs as soon as possible so arrangements can be organized.

September 12, 2024 - January 17, 2025Visit the lobby at Idea Exchange Queen's Square to experience an installation featuring a vibrant collection of items draping the doorway. The installation encourages a moment of pause to wonder and search as the work inspires critiques of consumerism. Torres’ installation uses familiar domestic, institutional, and recreational items to elevate our appreciation of the everyday while also inviting reflection on the challenges of consumer culture—our tendency to accumulate and the growing complexities of storing, recycling, and disposing of surplus goods.This installation reuses the items from Material Culture, an exhibition produced by the University of Waterloo Art Gallery. They generously allowed us to give the items another life before donating them to consumer distribution.Explore: José Luis Torres: A Site-Specific InstallationAccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your
