This exhibition coincides with Wright Vartanian’s book release, Stitching Science: Exploring Science from A to Z, published by Firefly Books in the fall of 2024.Lauren Wright Vartanian is a multidisciplinary artist currently focusing on textile art.

November 30, 2024 - February 23, 2025Curated by Karly BoileauWith a focus on a slow-making process through a Japanese heritage craft practice, Hitoko Okada’s major solo exhibition explores new ceramic and textile works that critically engage with and question the global fashion supply chain as it relates to colonial histories of fast fashion. Her works draw inspiration from geological processes and metabolic evolution of fungi, to apply ancestral knowledge in a present-day context to re-imagine futurisms and ways of being through a queer lens.Explore Setsubun - sacred offerings to the divine divideAccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your needs as soon as possible so arrangements can be organized.
