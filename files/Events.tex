September 12, 2024 - January 17, 2025Visit the lobby at Idea Exchange Queen's Square to experience an installation featuring a vibrant collection of items draping the doorway. The installation encourages a moment of pause to wonder and search as the work inspires critiques of consumerism. Torres’ installation uses familiar domestic, institutional, and recreational items to elevate our appreciation of the everyday while also inviting reflection on the challenges of consumer culture—our tendency to accumulate and the growing complexities of storing, recycling, and disposing of surplus goods.This installation reuses the items from Material Culture, an exhibition produced by the University of Waterloo Art Gallery.

Learn this well-known code used in amateur radio, aviation, and the military.Join members of the Cambridge Amateur Radio Club in an eight-week series of classes that will teach you to use Morse code and some of the history behind it.Morse code, or CW as known among amateur radio operators, is using a combination of short and long ‘beeps’ of a tone. The number and the combination of short and long ‘beeps’ will signify a letter. You will be surprised at how quickly you adapt to sense the difference among the various combinations and translate it to a letter, forming words and sentences. Learning Morse code is a great way to challenge your mind and keep it sharp.Amateur Radio (ham radio) is a popular hobby and service that brings people, electronics, and communication together. People use amateur radio to talk across town, around the world, or even into space, all without the Internet or cell phones.
