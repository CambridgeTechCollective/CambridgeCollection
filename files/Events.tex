Culture Days: Remembering the Flood of '74: Building the Living Levee"Forever etched in the memories of long-time Cambridge residents is the Great Flood of ’74. On May 17th of that year, the spring melt and weeks of rainy weather had caused the water levels in the Grand River to rise to record levels; there was little that could be done as the water poured over the banks and into Cambridge, overwhelming Galt and communities further south. It was the worst flash flooding in twenty years, causing nearly \$34 million in damage. In the aftermath of that historic flood, and to reduce the risk of future flooding, the Cambridge Living Levee as constructed along the river to protect Galt’s historic downtown core.Plan to join McDougall Cottage staff for an enlightening Culture Days walk. We’ll travel the path of the levee to explore this excellent example of human adaptation to flooding hazards, and learn how the levee continues to preserve the community around us.These free walks will leave fro

Authors Shantell Powel, Bill Coates, Cynthia Missabie, and Hope Engel read and share from the new anthology Mihko Kiskisiwin.Thomas King said, “The truth about stories is… stories are all that we are.” Colonization has tried to erase and eradicate Indigenous narratives for centuries. Even mainstream literature features the same kinds of stories told by the same voices. It fails to recognize the diversity of voices across Turtle Island. Stories exist and persist in diverse and divergent forms.Mihko Kiskisiwin is collection of Indigenous North American voices, from incarcerated and diversified Indigenous community members, elders, and youth to people with disabilities and 2SLGBTQIA+ people. This anthology by the Indigenous Poets Society (Saskatchewan–Ontario) showcases spoken and written poetry, fiction, and creative non-fiction from emerging and established artists, writers, and performers.Testimony is at the heart of this collection.
