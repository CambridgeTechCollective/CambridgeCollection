The goal of this festival is to capture the promise and challenges of migration, celebrate the contributions that migrants make to their new communities, and to help our community better understand the challenges our newcomer neighbors overcome as they make our region our home.This year, the festival will take place in late summer. Our goal is to foster open discussions and promote a sense of belonging and community through respectful dialogues. Storytelling is a powerful tool for addressing social issues, and the Waterloo Region Migration Film Festival serves as an educational platform to influence perceptions and advocate for basic human rights.About the Immigration PartnershipImmigration Partnership is a collaboration of community service, business, municipal, and post-secondary organizations and Waterloo Region residents working together. We work together to create the conditions for immigrants to succeed and help build a welcoming, dynamic community. We achieve this through leadership, collaboration, research, engagement, education, and advocacy. When immigrants reach their full potential, they contribute to creating and sustaining a thriving, prosperous community for everyone.AGE GROUP: |\\nTeens |\\nNewcomers |\\nKids |\\nAdults |EVENT TYPE: |\\nPrograms + Workshops |TAGS: |\\nWelcoming Week |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/11662693", "date": {"start": "2024-09-21T14:00:00Z", "end": "2024-09-21T15:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Clemens Mill - Children's Department IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2024-09-01T13:03:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent11423721", "eventName": "Tween D&D", "description": "Learn to play Dungeons & Dragons, the world's most popular role-playing game.An introductory Dungeons & Dragons session designed for younger players.

Even mainstream literature features the same kinds of stories told by the same voices. It fails to recognize the diversity of voices across Turtle Island. Stories exist and persist in diverse and divergent forms.Mihko Kiskisiwin is collection of Indigenous North American voices, from incarcerated and diversified Indigenous community members, elders, and youth to people with disabilities and 2SLGBTQIA+ people. This anthology by the Indigenous Poets Society (Saskatchewan\u2013Ontario) showcases spoken and written poetry, fiction, and creative non-fiction from emerging and established artists, writers, and performers.Testimony is at the heart of this collection. With vulnerability and urgency, these writers illuminate the complexities of trauma, identity, and healing. By empowering diverse and divergent Indigenous voices, intersectional awareness and diversity flourish. We see how one story can\u2019t possibly encapsulate the breadth of Indigenous North American cultures and experiences.In Cree, \u201cMihko Kiskisiwin\u201d means \u201cblood memory\u201d.

Her latest work, Stitching Science, merges art and science in 27 intricate diagrammatic embroideries. A culmination of three years of work and countless stitches, these embroideries, each representing a letter of the alphabet, depict scientific concepts in a creative and accessible way. This exhibition coincides with Wright Vartanian\u2019s book release, Stitching Science: Exploring Science from A to Z, published by Firefly Books in the fall of 2024.Lauren Wright Vartanian is a multidisciplinary artist currently focusing on textile art. She has a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Drawing and Painting from OCAD University, where she graduated in 2006. She has been creating and selling art under the name Neurons and Nebulas since 2016. Her work blends art and science in a way that is fun and educational, but also beautiful and inviting.
