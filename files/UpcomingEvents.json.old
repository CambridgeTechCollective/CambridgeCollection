This project materializes as an immersive and organically designed architectural ensemble, beckoning visitors to explore its depths and take ownership of the space itself.Conscient que le mouvement est aussi une construction de soi, Torres est attentif aux bifurcations et aux changements de direction qui fa\u00e7onnent notre mode de vie contemporain. L\u2019installations cr\u00e9ent des espaces d\u2019interrogations sur une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 dans laquelle le d\u00e9placement appelle la fragilit\u00e9 ainsi que la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019adaptation de l\u2019\u00eatre humain. \u00c0 l'intersection entre l'art et l'architecture, ou plut\u00f4t produit de leur synergie, D\u00e9rives se manifeste comme un espace de libert\u00e9 o\u00f9 tous les \u00e9changes sont possibles. Le projet est un ensemble sculptural organique et immersif en qu\u00eate d\u2019exploration, jouant avec le rapport d\u2019\u00e9chelle en fonction de l\u2019appropriation qu\u2019en fait le visiteur.Explore D\u00e9rivesAGE GROUP: |\\nCambridge Art Galleries |EVENT TYPE: |\\nExhibitions + Openings |TAGS: |\\nsculpture |\\nExhibitions |\\narchitecture |\\n#Arts |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/9579988", "date": {"start": "2024-02-18T00:00:00Z", "end": "2024-02-18T23:59:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Preston - Gallery IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2024-01-19T13:48:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent9580930", "eventName": "Repeating Granadas", "description": "January 20 to April 21, 2024Curated by Karly Boileau\u201cBy sending our voices, visuals and visions outward into the world, we alter the walls and make them a framework for new windows and doors\u201d - Gloria Anazald\u00faaSurrounded by glints of silver and gold, rich browns, patterns, and allegory,\u00a0Michelle Peraza\u2019s solo exhibition, Repeating Granadas presents artwork in the form of site-specific installations, painting, and drawing as a means to process the ambiguity and complexity of being LatinX.\u201cEnviando nuestras voces, visuales y visiones al exterior en el mundo, nosotros alteramos las paredes y hacemos los marcos para nuevas ventanas y puertas\u201d - Gloria Anzald\u00faaRodeada de destellos de plata y oro, abundante color caf\u00e9, patrones, y alegor\u00eda, la exhibici\u00f3n individual de Michelle Peraza, Repeating Granadas, presenta su trabajo art\u00edstico en forma de instalaci\u00f3n en un sitio espec\u00edfico, pinturas, y dibujos como una manera de procesar la ambig\u00fcedad y complejidad de ser LatinX.Explore Repeating GranadasAGE GROUP: |\\nCambridge Art Galleries |EVENT TYPE: |\\nExhibitions + Openings |TAGS: |\\npainting |\\nExhibitions |\\n#Arts |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/9580930", "date": {"start": "2024-02-18T00:00:00Z", "end": "2024-02-18T23:59:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Queen's Square - Gallery IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2024-01-19T13:48:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "calendarwaterlooregionmuseumcaDefaultDetail2024-02-18-1200-Family-Day-Winter-Carnival-Weekend", "eventName": "Family Day Winter Carnival Weekend!", "description": "Celebrate Family Day at Schneider Haus with our winter carnival theme all weekend long!
