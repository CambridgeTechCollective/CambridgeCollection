It is where residents gather to talk about food and community happenings. It\u2019s where awareness is built and the beginnings of change takes place.The CFM dates back to the 1830s with the current market building holding its seat on Dickson Street since 1887. The presence of the market in conjunction with other civic structures, the Town Halls, is an English tradition that is as relevant today as it was when the market was built.The CFM building\u2019s continued use as a market is unique in Ontario. While other markets either remain outdoors only or have had their original buildings converted for other uses, the CFM has continued to flourish in its original location in its original building for its original intended use and this should be celebrated.As you explore the market, the sweet and spicy aromas of hot prepared foods and snacks will tempt you, along with an extensive selection of cheeses, chutneys, pies, confections, specialty oils, preserves, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.A wide range of local growers and food producers can supply you with all your needs from savoury appetizers to mouth-watering desserts.Our market wouldn\u2019t exist without those dedicated vendors, some of whom have been a part of our team for over 50 years. They arrive in the snow and in the rain, or in the heat of summer, often setting up as early as 3:30 in the morning and many don\u2019t pack up until more than 12 hours later.We have 26 year-round vendors and 30 seasonal vendors, averaging 56 vendors at the peak of the market season, who supply approximately 35,000 shopper visits each year.You can learn more about our vendors by visiting the vendor directory on our website, cambridgefarmersmarket.ca.The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open Saturdays from 7 am to 1 pm, year-round. It is located at\u00a0the corner of Ainslie Street and Dickson Street, in the heart of downtown Cambridge, and parking is available nearby.For more information, visit cambridgefarmersmarket.ca", "sourceURL": "https://calendar.cambridge.ca/default/Detail/2023-11-18-0700-Cambridge-Farmers-Market", "date": {"start": "2023-11-18T07:00:00Z", "end": "2023-11-18T13:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "40 Dickson St,", "address": "40 Dickson St,"}, "organizer": {"name": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "contact": {"email": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "phone": ""}}, "tags": ["CityCam"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-11-17T20:56:00Z", "scraperID": "Cam0002JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent8867291", "eventName": "Visible Mending", "description": "Visible Mending is guaranteed to liven up your wardrobe!Local mending enthusiast Elysha will guide you through the basics of garment repair.

It is where residents gather to talk about food and community happenings. It\u2019s where awareness is built and the beginnings of change takes place.The CFM dates back to the 1830s with the current market building holding its seat on Dickson Street since 1887. The presence of the market in conjunction with other civic structures, the Town Halls, is an English tradition that is as relevant today as it was when the market was built.The CFM building\u2019s continued use as a market is unique in Ontario. While other markets either remain outdoors only or have had their original buildings converted for other uses, the CFM has continued to flourish in its original location in its original building for its original intended use and this should be celebrated.As you explore the market, the sweet and spicy aromas of hot prepared foods and snacks will tempt you, along with an extensive selection of cheeses, chutneys, pies, confections, specialty oils, preserves, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.A wide range of local growers and food producers can supply you with all your needs from savoury appetizers to mouth-watering desserts.Our market wouldn\u2019t exist without those dedicated vendors, some of whom have been a part of our team for over 50 years. They arrive in the snow and in the rain, or in the heat of summer, often setting up as early as 3:30 in the morning and many don\u2019t pack up until more than 12 hours later.We have 26 year-round vendors and 30 seasonal vendors, averaging 56 vendors at the peak of the market season, who supply approximately 35,000 shopper visits each year.You can learn more about our vendors by visiting the vendor directory on our website, cambridgefarmersmarket.ca.The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open Saturdays from 7 am to 1 pm, year-round.

Her work sits at the intersection of the subjugated body and histories of cloth with a particular focus on South Asia and it\u2019s diasporas. She is interested in the making, wearing, and disposing of cloth; clothing as a form of self-expression and resistance; and the ways by which textile is constituted over vast geographies. Through her work, she delves deep into our understanding of the self, the body, cloth and clothing, including it\u2019s histories, resonances, and possibilities. Her work has been exhibited nationally and internationally and can be found in the permanent collection of the Royal Ontario Museum and the Wedge Collection. She lives and works in the traditional territory of the Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee, Huron-Wendat, and Mississaugas of the Credit River. Her exhibitions Cotton Exchange and Outerwhere are currently on view at Cambridge Art Galleries.Dr Natasha Bissonauth teaches Visual Art and Art History at York University (Toronto). Prior to York University she was Assistant Professor of Women\u2019s Gender, and Sexuality Studies at the College of Wooster. She received her Ph.D. in Art History at Cornell University and her research centers queer, trans, and feminist contemporary art practices with expertise in South Asia and its multiple diasporas. Recent research interests expand on indenture studies, archival work, and material cultures. She is currently working on a book project that investigates aesthetic encounters with archival fragments in ways that creates passage between legacies of immigration and indenture. By threading \u2018areas\u2019 like South Asia, the Caribbean, and Mauritius, Black and brown seams within the discipline emerge. Select publications include \u201cSunil Gupta\u2019s\u00a0Sun City: An Exercise in Camping Orientalism\u201d (Art Journal;\u00a0 2019), \u201cThe Future of Museological Display: Chitra Ganesh\u2019s Speculative Encounters\u201d (in\u00a0Museums, Sexuality, and Gender Activism, 2020), and \u201cThe Dissent of Play: Lotahs in the Museum\u201d (South Asia, 2020).\u00a0Recent articles examine gender and indenture aesthetics in Kama La Mackerel\u2019s poetry and Renluka Maharaj\u2019s visual practice. Several exhibition catalog essays are forthcoming, on the artistic practice of Zanele Muholi, Chitra Ganesh, and Meera Sethi, respectively. Additionally, Bissonauth will contribute an exhibition essay for Divya Mehra\u2019s next solo exhibition, winner of the Sobey Art Award in 2022. Select artist interviews, exhibition reviews, and book reviews appear in\u00a0\u00a0Art Asia Pacific,\u00a0Art India,\u00a0C Magazine,\u00a0 and\u00a0Women + Performance.

It is where residents gather to talk about food and community happenings. It\u2019s where awareness is built and the beginnings of change takes place.The CFM dates back to the 1830s with the current market building holding its seat on Dickson Street since 1887. The presence of the market in conjunction with other civic structures, the Town Halls, is an English tradition that is as relevant today as it was when the market was built.The CFM building\u2019s continued use as a market is unique in Ontario. While other markets either remain outdoors only or have had their original buildings converted for other uses, the CFM has continued to flourish in its original location in its original building for its original intended use and this should be celebrated.As you explore the market, the sweet and spicy aromas of hot prepared foods and snacks will tempt you, along with an extensive selection of cheeses, chutneys, pies, confections, specialty oils, preserves, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.A wide range of local growers and food producers can supply you with all your needs from savoury appetizers to mouth-watering desserts.Our market wouldn\u2019t exist without those dedicated vendors, some of whom have been a part of our team for over 50 years. They arrive in the snow and in the rain, or in the heat of summer, often setting up as early as 3:30 in the morning and many don\u2019t pack up until more than 12 hours later.We have 26 year-round vendors and 30 seasonal vendors, averaging 56 vendors at the peak of the market season, who supply approximately 35,000 shopper visits each year.You can learn more about our vendors by visiting the vendor directory on our website, cambridgefarmersmarket.ca.The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open Saturdays from 7 am to 1 pm, year-round.

It is where residents gather to talk about food and community happenings. It\u2019s where awareness is built and the beginnings of change takes place.The CFM dates back to the 1830s with the current market building holding its seat on Dickson Street since 1887. The presence of the market in conjunction with other civic structures, the Town Halls, is an English tradition that is as relevant today as it was when the market was built.The CFM building\u2019s continued use as a market is unique in Ontario. While other markets either remain outdoors only or have had their original buildings converted for other uses, the CFM has continued to flourish in its original location in its original building for its original intended use and this should be celebrated.As you explore the market, the sweet and spicy aromas of hot prepared foods and snacks will tempt you, along with an extensive selection of cheeses, chutneys, pies, confections, specialty oils, preserves, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.A wide range of local growers and food producers can supply you with all your needs from savoury appetizers to mouth-watering desserts.Our market wouldn\u2019t exist without those dedicated vendors, some of whom have been a part of our team for over 50 years. They arrive in the snow and in the rain, or in the heat of summer, often setting up as early as 3:30 in the morning and many don\u2019t pack up until more than 12 hours later.We have 26 year-round vendors and 30 seasonal vendors, averaging 56 vendors at the peak of the market season, who supply approximately 35,000 shopper visits each year.You can learn more about our vendors by visiting the vendor directory on our website, cambridgefarmersmarket.ca.The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open Saturdays from 7 am to 1 pm, year-round.

It is where residents gather to talk about food and community happenings. It\u2019s where awareness is built and the beginnings of change takes place.The CFM dates back to the 1830s with the current market building holding its seat on Dickson Street since 1887. The presence of the market in conjunction with other civic structures, the Town Halls, is an English tradition that is as relevant today as it was when the market was built.The CFM building\u2019s continued use as a market is unique in Ontario. While other markets either remain outdoors only or have had their original buildings converted for other uses, the CFM has continued to flourish in its original location in its original building for its original intended use and this should be celebrated.As you explore the market, the sweet and spicy aromas of hot prepared foods and snacks will tempt you, along with an extensive selection of cheeses, chutneys, pies, confections, specialty oils, preserves, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.A wide range of local growers and food producers can supply you with all your needs from savoury appetizers to mouth-watering desserts.Our market wouldn\u2019t exist without those dedicated vendors, some of whom have been a part of our team for over 50 years. They arrive in the snow and in the rain, or in the heat of summer, often setting up as early as 3:30 in the morning and many don\u2019t pack up until more than 12 hours later.We have 26 year-round vendors and 30 seasonal vendors, averaging 56 vendors at the peak of the market season, who supply approximately 35,000 shopper visits each year.You can learn more about our vendors by visiting the vendor directory on our website, cambridgefarmersmarket.ca.The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open Saturdays from 7 am to 1 pm, year-round. It is located at\u00a0the corner of Ainslie Street and Dickson Street, in the heart of downtown Cambridge, and parking is available nearby.For more information, visit cambridgefarmersmarket.ca", "sourceURL": "https://calendar.cambridge.ca/default/Detail/2023-12-16-0700-Cambridge-Farmers-Market", "date": {"start": "2023-12-16T07:00:00Z", "end": "2023-12-16T13:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "40 Dickson St,", "address": "40 Dickson St,"}, "organizer": {"name": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "contact": {"email": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "phone": ""}}, "tags": ["CityCam"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-11-17T20:56:00Z", "scraperID": "Cam0002JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent9491858", "eventName": "Reindeer Games", "description": "Get ready for a series of festive challenges, competitions, and crafts.Our elves have been hard at work putting together 'Minute-to-Win-It' challenges that will cause jolly laughs; Prancer has planned some sneaky scavenger hunts, and Comet has crafted glorious gift stations. \"Yule\" be sure to have a merry time!This drop-in program is a great way to get into the holiday spirit with your family.Cost: FreeAGE GROUP: |\\nKids |EVENT TYPE: |\\nPrograms + Workshops |TAGS: |\\nScavenger Hunts |\\nHolidays |\\nGames |\\nChallenges |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/9491858", "date": {"start": "2023-12-16T11:00:00Z", "end": "2023-12-16T16:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Clemens Mill - Children's Department IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-11-17T20:56:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "calendarwaterlooregionmuseumcaDefaultDetail2023-12-16-1100-Special-Christmas-Teas-by-the-Grand-at-McDougall-C", "eventName": "Special Christmas Teas by the Grand at McDougall Cottage", "description": "Find some time for calm this holiday season by joining us at McDougall Cottage for a jolly Christmas Tea.The Cottage will be decked out in festive style for this classic, seasonal tea that includes tasty finger sandwiches, freshly-baked scones with whipped cream and preserves, alongside some special Christmas treats and, as always, a bottomless tea pot.This would make a great gift for a friend or two - what could be better than great company, cheerful conversation and tasty holiday treats in a cozy, 165 year old stone Cottage?Reservations are required and space is limited, so reserve your spot now!Museum Members receive a 10% discount.Please note:", "sourceURL": "https://calendar.waterlooregionmuseum.ca/Default/Detail/2023-12-16-1100-Special-Christmas-Teas-by-the-Grand-at-McDougall-C", "date": {"start": "2023-12-16T11:00:00Z", "end": "2023-12-16T12:30:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "89 Grand Ave. S.
