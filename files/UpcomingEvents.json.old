This event will conclude with a brief opportunity to ask questions.About the presenterAashay Dalvi, anti-racism consultant for SPECTRUM and founder of Rad Riot Books, discusses the importance of anti-colonial representation in literature. They have previously spoken about queer-affirming and anti-colonial literature at the University of Waterloo, the GSA Conference, Tri-Pride, Kitchener Public Library, and more across Waterloo Region.Aashay\u2019s work is guided by the understanding that decolonizing one\u2019s own perspective begins with seeking out and embracing voices that challenge the status quo. Frequently, narratives from queer, racialized, and non-Eurocentric immigrant voices are sidelined or misrepresented in mainstream media, despite providing invaluable insight into the larger colonial systems that perpetuate inequities within our community. Rad Riot Books was started with the purpose of challenging imperialism and settler colonialism by providing a safe space where queer and racialized newcomers as well as curious members of the community could feel empowered to explore these ideas in diverse and anti-racist book selections.AccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your needs as soon as possible so arrangements can be organized.

My first experiences with wetlands came early in life growing up on a farm near Point Pelee National Park and working in the Visitor Centre at the park for many summers. My love of these environments evolved over the years into a deeper concern for loss of these habitats and all that they support. Wetlands are unique places with environmental, spiritual, health, cultural, and social significance. They are rich biodiverse environments that team with life and provide an ever changing and evolving source of beauty. In these times of water and climate crisis, they play a major role in water filtration, flood mitigation, soil stabilization, nutrient cycling, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration and habitat for a diverse range of species, and plants (including medicinal and food sources).Explore: ShallowsAccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your needs as soon as possible so arrangements can be organized.

My love of these environments evolved over the years into a deeper concern for loss of these habitats and all that they support. Wetlands are unique places with environmental, spiritual, health, cultural, and social significance. They are rich biodiverse environments that team with life and provide an ever changing and evolving source of beauty. In these times of water and climate crisis, they play a major role in water filtration, flood mitigation, soil stabilization, nutrient cycling, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration and habitat for a diverse range of species, and plants (including medicinal and food sources).Explore: ShallowsAccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your needs as soon as possible so arrangements can be organized.

My first experiences with wetlands came early in life growing up on a farm near Point Pelee National Park and working in the Visitor Centre at the park for many summers. My love of these environments evolved over the years into a deeper concern for loss of these habitats and all that they support. Wetlands are unique places with environmental, spiritual, health, cultural, and social significance. They are rich biodiverse environments that team with life and provide an ever changing and evolving source of beauty. In these times of water and climate crisis, they play a major role in water filtration, flood mitigation, soil stabilization, nutrient cycling, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration and habitat for a diverse range of species, and plants (including medicinal and food sources).Explore: ShallowsAccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your needs as soon as possible so arrangements can be organized.

My love of these environments evolved over the years into a deeper concern for loss of these habitats and all that they support. Wetlands are unique places with environmental, spiritual, health, cultural, and social significance. They are rich biodiverse environments that team with life and provide an ever changing and evolving source of beauty. In these times of water and climate crisis, they play a major role in water filtration, flood mitigation, soil stabilization, nutrient cycling, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration and habitat for a diverse range of species, and plants (including medicinal and food sources).Explore: ShallowsAccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your needs as soon as possible so arrangements can be organized.

Any approach is welcome (sewing, painting, applique, felting, etc.), and we encourage experimentation and creativity. The most important thing is that each square should tell your story or depict your relationship to the river. Rather than a traditional rectangular quilt, each of your squares will be tied together to create the shape of the river and be displayed with a map of the Grand River watershed identifying where each square came from. We will also display a matching \u201cquilt\u201d of your stories about each square.About our Partner:The Grand River Community Play Project: The Voice of a River is an interdisciplinary piece that will connect the communities and inhabitants that live along the length of the Grand River \u2013 a river that starts in the highlands of Dufferin County, travels 310 km, before emptying into Lake Erie at Port Maitland. About a million people live within the watershed, a watershed that passes cities, towns, villages, trees, wild grasses, coyotes, and includes thirty-nine municipalities and two First Nations territories.The Voice of a River is about community and the meaningful connection to Indigenous leaders and communities along the Grand River. It is an inclusive creative activity involving artists, municipal and Indigenous leaders, scientists, Elders, Community folk, children, NFP organizations, educational institutions \u2013 and most importantly the Grand River. This is a project about storytelling \u2013 in all the ways stories can be told \u2013 in spoken word, in song, in dance, ceremony, in art installation, in silence, through different cultural lenses, and via technology. It is being imagined as an environmental experience \u2013 something that will develop and build over time, leading toward a unique presentation in all four seasons, and over many years, passing the experience along to the next generations for them to reimagine, for them to inhabit with their own stories.AccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your needs as soon as possible so arrangements can be organized.

My first experiences with wetlands came early in life growing up on a farm near Point Pelee National Park and working in the Visitor Centre at the park for many summers. My love of these environments evolved over the years into a deeper concern for loss of these habitats and all that they support. Wetlands are unique places with environmental, spiritual, health, cultural, and social significance. They are rich biodiverse environments that team with life and provide an ever changing and evolving source of beauty. In these times of water and climate crisis, they play a major role in water filtration, flood mitigation, soil stabilization, nutrient cycling, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration and habitat for a diverse range of species, and plants (including medicinal and food sources).Explore: ShallowsAccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your needs as soon as possible so arrangements can be organized.

My first experiences with wetlands came early in life growing up on a farm near Point Pelee National Park and working in the Visitor Centre at the park for many summers. My love of these environments evolved over the years into a deeper concern for loss of these habitats and all that they support. Wetlands are unique places with environmental, spiritual, health, cultural, and social significance. They are rich biodiverse environments that team with life and provide an ever changing and evolving source of beauty. In these times of water and climate crisis, they play a major role in water filtration, flood mitigation, soil stabilization, nutrient cycling, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration and habitat for a diverse range of species, and plants (including medicinal and food sources).Explore: ShallowsAccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your needs as soon as possible so arrangements can be organized.
