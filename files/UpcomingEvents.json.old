It is where residents gather to talk about food and community happenings. It\u2019s where awareness is built and the beginnings of change takes place.The CFM dates back to the 1830s with the current market building holding its seat on Dickson Street since 1887. The presence of the market in conjunction with other civic structures, the Town Halls, is an English tradition that is as relevant today as it was when the market was built.The CFM building\u2019s continued use as a market is unique in Ontario. While other markets either remain outdoors only or have had their original buildings converted for other uses, the CFM has continued to flourish in its original location in its original building for its original intended use and this should be celebrated.As you explore the market, the sweet and spicy aromas of hot prepared foods and snacks will tempt you, along with an extensive selection of cheeses, chutneys, pies, confections, specialty oils, preserves, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.A wide range of local growers and food producers can supply you with all your needs from savoury appetizers to mouth-watering desserts.Our market wouldn\u2019t exist without those dedicated vendors, some of whom have been a part of our team for over 50 years. They arrive in the snow and in the rain, or in the heat of summer, often setting up as early as 3:30 in the morning and many don\u2019t pack up until more than 12 hours later.We have 26 year-round vendors and 30 seasonal vendors, averaging 56 vendors at the peak of the market season, who supply approximately 35,000 shopper visits each year.You can learn more about our vendors by visiting the vendor directory on our website, cambridgefarmersmarket.ca.The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open Saturdays from 7 am to 1 pm, year-round.

Her work is a tactile fruit salad with a soup\u00e7on of the esoteric. She has exhibited and performed both nationally and internationally and her work has been featured in publications such as: The New York Times, Harper\u2019s Bazaar Japan, Nylon Magazine and Giant Robot Magazine. She was awarded the 2020 Best of Craft and Design Award from the Toronto Outdoor Art Fair.In addition to maintaining her art practice in Guelph, Alisa also acts as a creative mentor and teacher/facilitator via various organizations including Art Not Shame. She unites her entrenchment in pop culture with her unparalleled sewing/sculpture/story-telling skills. She is inspired by other handmade items such as quilts and afghans for her, these items have a feeling of nostalgia and comfort to them. In addition, Alisa often uses recycled materials to lend to the nostalgic feel as well as fit with her philosophy of re-using what she has. https://www.alisamcronald.com/This program is offered in partnership with Spectrum, Waterloo Region\u2019s Rainbow Community Space.AGE GROUP: |\\nCambridge Art Galleries |\\nAdults |EVENT TYPE: |\\nPrograms + Workshops |TAGS: |\\n#Arts |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/8861315", "date": {"start": "2023-10-19T18:00:00Z", "end": "2023-10-19T20:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Queen's Square - Lobby IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-10-07T15:08:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent9098199", "eventName": "Next in Soldering", "description": "Take on a bigger project while learning the basics of soldering.Learn about circuits and soldering by creating a small Bluetooth speaker.All supplies included.Cost: FreeAGE GROUP: |\\nTeens |\\nAdults |EVENT TYPE: |\\nPrograms + Workshops |\\nMaker Programs |TAGS: |\\nTechTraining |\\nTechnology |\\nSoldering |\\nMakerspace |\\nMaker |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/9098199", "date": {"start": "2023-10-19T18:30:00Z", "end": "2023-10-19T20:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Old Post Office - IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-10-07T15:08:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent9117466", "eventName": "MMMMunsch!

It is where residents gather to talk about food and community happenings. It\u2019s where awareness is built and the beginnings of change takes place.The CFM dates back to the 1830s with the current market building holding its seat on Dickson Street since 1887. The presence of the market in conjunction with other civic structures, the Town Halls, is an English tradition that is as relevant today as it was when the market was built.The CFM building\u2019s continued use as a market is unique in Ontario. While other markets either remain outdoors only or have had their original buildings converted for other uses, the CFM has continued to flourish in its original location in its original building for its original intended use and this should be celebrated.As you explore the market, the sweet and spicy aromas of hot prepared foods and snacks will tempt you, along with an extensive selection of cheeses, chutneys, pies, confections, specialty oils, preserves, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.A wide range of local growers and food producers can supply you with all your needs from savoury appetizers to mouth-watering desserts.Our market wouldn\u2019t exist without those dedicated vendors, some of whom have been a part of our team for over 50 years. They arrive in the snow and in the rain, or in the heat of summer, often setting up as early as 3:30 in the morning and many don\u2019t pack up until more than 12 hours later.We have 26 year-round vendors and 30 seasonal vendors, averaging 56 vendors at the peak of the market season, who supply approximately 35,000 shopper visits each year.You can learn more about our vendors by visiting the vendor directory on our website, cambridgefarmersmarket.ca.The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open Saturdays from 7 am to 1 pm, year-round.

It is where residents gather to talk about food and community happenings. It\u2019s where awareness is built and the beginnings of change takes place.The CFM dates back to the 1830s with the current market building holding its seat on Dickson Street since 1887. The presence of the market in conjunction with other civic structures, the Town Halls, is an English tradition that is as relevant today as it was when the market was built.The CFM building\u2019s continued use as a market is unique in Ontario. While other markets either remain outdoors only or have had their original buildings converted for other uses, the CFM has continued to flourish in its original location in its original building for its original intended use and this should be celebrated.As you explore the market, the sweet and spicy aromas of hot prepared foods and snacks will tempt you, along with an extensive selection of cheeses, chutneys, pies, confections, specialty oils, preserves, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.A wide range of local growers and food producers can supply you with all your needs from savoury appetizers to mouth-watering desserts.Our market wouldn\u2019t exist without those dedicated vendors, some of whom have been a part of our team for over 50 years. They arrive in the snow and in the rain, or in the heat of summer, often setting up as early as 3:30 in the morning and many don\u2019t pack up until more than 12 hours later.We have 26 year-round vendors and 30 seasonal vendors, averaging 56 vendors at the peak of the market season, who supply approximately 35,000 shopper visits each year.You can learn more about our vendors by visiting the vendor directory on our website, cambridgefarmersmarket.ca.The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open Saturdays from 7 am to 1 pm, year-round. It is located at\u00a0the corner of Ainslie Street and Dickson Street, in the heart of downtown Cambridge, and parking is available nearby.For more information, visit cambridgefarmersmarket.ca", "sourceURL": "https://calendar.cambridge.ca/default/Detail/2023-10-28-0700-Cambridge-Farmers-Market", "date": {"start": "2023-10-28T07:00:00Z", "end": "2023-10-28T13:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "40 Dickson St,", "address": "40 Dickson St,"}, "organizer": {"name": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "contact": {"email": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "phone": ""}}, "tags": ["CityCam"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-10-07T15:08:00Z", "scraperID": "Cam0002JSON"}, {"eventId": "calendarcambridgecadefaultDetail2023-10-28-0830-ECU-a-Division-of-WFCU-Credit-Union-Trick-or-Trot", "eventName": "ECU - a Division of WFCU Credit Union Trick or Trot", "description": "This October, we are proud to host Waterloo Region\u2019s inaugural\u00a0ECU \u2013 a Division of WFCU Credit Union Trick or Trot!\u00a0A Halloween-themed\u00a05K Run, 5K Walk, and 1K or 250m Kids Dash,\u00a0this new community event offers family fun you won\u2019t want to miss!Alongside the 5K Run, 5K Walk, and Kids Dash, we will be hosting a\u00a0Halloween Costume Contest.

It is where residents gather to talk about food and community happenings. It\u2019s where awareness is built and the beginnings of change takes place.The CFM dates back to the 1830s with the current market building holding its seat on Dickson Street since 1887. The presence of the market in conjunction with other civic structures, the Town Halls, is an English tradition that is as relevant today as it was when the market was built.The CFM building\u2019s continued use as a market is unique in Ontario. While other markets either remain outdoors only or have had their original buildings converted for other uses, the CFM has continued to flourish in its original location in its original building for its original intended use and this should be celebrated.As you explore the market, the sweet and spicy aromas of hot prepared foods and snacks will tempt you, along with an extensive selection of cheeses, chutneys, pies, confections, specialty oils, preserves, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.A wide range of local growers and food producers can supply you with all your needs from savoury appetizers to mouth-watering desserts.Our market wouldn\u2019t exist without those dedicated vendors, some of whom have been a part of our team for over 50 years. They arrive in the snow and in the rain, or in the heat of summer, often setting up as early as 3:30 in the morning and many don\u2019t pack up until more than 12 hours later.We have 26 year-round vendors and 30 seasonal vendors, averaging 56 vendors at the peak of the market season, who supply approximately 35,000 shopper visits each year.You can learn more about our vendors by visiting the vendor directory on our website, cambridgefarmersmarket.ca.The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open Saturdays from 7 am to 1 pm, year-round. It is located at\u00a0the corner of Ainslie Street and Dickson Street, in the heart of downtown Cambridge, and parking is available nearby.For more information, visit cambridgefarmersmarket.ca", "sourceURL": "https://calendar.cambridge.ca/default/Detail/2023-11-04-0700-Cambridge-Farmers-Market", "date": {"start": "2023-11-04T07:00:00Z", "end": "2023-11-04T13:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "40 Dickson St,", "address": "40 Dickson St,"}, "organizer": {"name": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "contact": {"email": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "phone": ""}}, "tags": ["CityCam"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-10-07T15:08:00Z", "scraperID": "Cam0002JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent8867348", "eventName": "Creating with Flowers", "description": "Make beautiful art using flowers in this fun workshop.Learn how to use flowers in various ways to make creative artworks including pressing, drying, and printing.
