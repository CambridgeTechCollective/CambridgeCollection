The goal of this festival is to capture the promise and challenges of migration, celebrate the contributions that migrants make to their new communities, and to help our community better understand the challenges our newcomer neighbors overcome as they make our region our home.This year, the festival will take place in late summer. Our goal is to foster open discussions and promote a sense of belonging and community through respectful dialogues. Storytelling is a powerful tool for addressing social issues, and the Waterloo Region Migration Film Festival serves as an educational platform to influence perceptions and advocate for basic human rights.About the Immigration PartnershipImmigration Partnership is a collaboration of community service, business, municipal, and post-secondary organizations and Waterloo Region residents working together. We work together to create the conditions for immigrants to succeed and help build a welcoming, dynamic community. We achieve this through leadership, collaboration, research, engagement, education, and advocacy.
