All are welcome and always free. Light snacks and refreshments will be served.Shallows\u00a0is an exhibition that represents my current focus on imagery derived from wetland habitats. My first experiences with wetlands came early in life growing up on a farm near Point Pelee National Park and working in the Visitor Centre at the park for many summers. My love of these environments evolved over the years into a deeper concern for loss of these habitats and all that they support. Wetlands are unique places with environmental, spiritual, health, cultural, and social significance. They are rich biodiverse environments that team with life and provide an ever changing and evolving source of beauty. In these times of water and climate crisis, they play a major role in water filtration, flood mitigation, soil stabilization, nutrient cycling, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration and habitat for a diverse range of species, and plants (including medicinal and food sources).I research concepts and imagery for my work through environmental readings, on-site drawing, underwater photography, sound recordings in wetland areas and through discussions with environmentally minded people. I am very grateful for artist friends such as Briana Palmer who helped to expand my print practice and my ideas of environmentally responsible approaches to art. I am also appreciative of McMaster University connections in biology, hydrology, English and Cultural Studies, and many other disciplines that have informed and deepened my commitment to environmental concerns.My studio practice embraces a poetic approach. The translucent flowing layers of fabric and play of light suggest a fluid ambiguous space that acts as a visual metaphor for water. Printed, collaged, and sewn additions reference plants and amphibians from local marshes either directly or in abstract ways. The large-scale work entitled\u00a0Reflections\u00a0includes a frog chorus sound component recorded in a Bruce Peninsula wetland providing a more immersive, sensory experience.This body of work incorporates fabric and sewing practices celebrating tactile material engagement and a return to attentive process. I am attracted to the slow pace of fibre-based work that is process oriented, measured, gentle and purposeful. Fabrics and sewing invite associations with concepts of mending, healing, and transformation, to reinforce ideas repair.\u00a0References to patching and the piecing together of fragments welcomes ideas of connection and renewal that are coupled with wetland imagery to suggest preservation, restoration, and celebration of these important habitats. There has been a wealth of scientific data on environmental concerns throughout my lifetime with many different strategies for raising awareness. The message here is not saturated with scientific data, nor does it prescribe any specific environmental action. It presents a quiet, visual experience intended to envelop the viewer in a space conducive to personal reflection, and caring about a habitat that is rapidly and quietly disappearing, despite its significance to our own survival.Judy Major-Girardin\u00a0received a BFA from the University of Windsor and an MFA from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. She is Professor Emerita from the School of the Arts at McMaster University where she taught for thirty-nine years.\u00a0 She lives in Cambridge Ontario and has served as Co-Chair of the Cambridge Sculpture Garden since 2005. Her studio work includes an integrated practise of painting, printmaking, drawing, artist books, and hanging fiber-based works that raise awareness for the preservation and celebration of wetland environments.

My first experiences with wetlands came early in life growing up on a farm near Point Pelee National Park and working in the Visitor Centre at the park for many summers. My love of these environments evolved over the years into a deeper concern for loss of these habitats and all that they support. Wetlands are unique places with environmental, spiritual, health, cultural, and social significance. They are rich biodiverse environments that team with life and provide an ever changing and evolving source of beauty. In these times of water and climate crisis, they play a major role in water filtration, flood mitigation, soil stabilization, nutrient cycling, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration and habitat for a diverse range of species, and plants (including medicinal and food sources).Explore: ShallowsAGE GROUP: |\\nCambridge Art Galleries |EVENT TYPE: |\\nExhibitions + Openings |TAGS: |\\nExhibitions |\\n#Arts |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/10327479", "date": {"start": "2024-05-14T00:00:00Z", "end": "2024-05-14T23:59:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Queen's Square - Gallery IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2024-05-10T06:12:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent9981214", "eventName": "Stories and Stretches", "description": "Stretch it out and get your body moving.Come enjoy this unique program with its combination of stories, movement activities, and fun!AccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your needs as soon as possible so arrangements can be organized.

My first experiences with wetlands came early in life growing up on a farm near Point Pelee National Park and working in the Visitor Centre at the park for many summers. My love of these environments evolved over the years into a deeper concern for loss of these habitats and all that they support. Wetlands are unique places with environmental, spiritual, health, cultural, and social significance. They are rich biodiverse environments that team with life and provide an ever changing and evolving source of beauty. In these times of water and climate crisis, they play a major role in water filtration, flood mitigation, soil stabilization, nutrient cycling, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration and habitat for a diverse range of species, and plants (including medicinal and food sources).Explore: ShallowsAGE GROUP: |\\nCambridge Art Galleries |EVENT TYPE: |\\nExhibitions + Openings |TAGS: |\\nExhibitions |\\n#Arts |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/10327480", "date": {"start": "2024-05-15T00:00:00Z", "end": "2024-05-15T23:59:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Queen's Square - Gallery IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2024-05-10T06:12:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent10265175", "eventName": "Sensory Tales", "description": "All the senses are celebrated in this inclusive sensory experience.Join us for an immersive\u00a0sensory\u00a0story time filled with adventure.AccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your needs as soon as possible so arrangements can be organized.

My first experiences with wetlands came early in life growing up on a farm near Point Pelee National Park and working in the Visitor Centre at the park for many summers. My love of these environments evolved over the years into a deeper concern for loss of these habitats and all that they support. Wetlands are unique places with environmental, spiritual, health, cultural, and social significance. They are rich biodiverse environments that team with life and provide an ever changing and evolving source of beauty. In these times of water and climate crisis, they play a major role in water filtration, flood mitigation, soil stabilization, nutrient cycling, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration and habitat for a diverse range of species, and plants (including medicinal and food sources).Explore: ShallowsAGE GROUP: |\\nCambridge Art Galleries |EVENT TYPE: |\\nExhibitions + Openings |TAGS: |\\nExhibitions |\\n#Arts |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/10327481", "date": {"start": "2024-05-16T00:00:00Z", "end": "2024-05-16T23:59:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Queen's Square - Gallery IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2024-05-10T06:12:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent10252035", "eventName": "Time for Twos and Threes", "description": "Bring your tot for some late-morning fun.

My first experiences with wetlands came early in life growing up on a farm near Point Pelee National Park and working in the Visitor Centre at the park for many summers. My love of these environments evolved over the years into a deeper concern for loss of these habitats and all that they support. Wetlands are unique places with environmental, spiritual, health, cultural, and social significance. They are rich biodiverse environments that team with life and provide an ever changing and evolving source of beauty. In these times of water and climate crisis, they play a major role in water filtration, flood mitigation, soil stabilization, nutrient cycling, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration and habitat for a diverse range of species, and plants (including medicinal and food sources).Explore: ShallowsAGE GROUP: |\\nCambridge Art Galleries |EVENT TYPE: |\\nExhibitions + Openings |TAGS: |\\nExhibitions |\\n#Arts |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/10327484", "date": {"start": "2024-05-21T00:00:00Z", "end": "2024-05-21T23:59:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Queen's Square - Gallery IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2024-05-10T06:12:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent9981215", "eventName": "Stories and Stretches", "description": "Stretch it out and get your body moving.Come enjoy this unique program with its combination of stories, movement activities, and fun!AccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your needs as soon as possible so arrangements can be organized.

My love of these environments evolved over the years into a deeper concern for loss of these habitats and all that they support. Wetlands are unique places with environmental, spiritual, health, cultural, and social significance. They are rich biodiverse environments that team with life and provide an ever changing and evolving source of beauty. In these times of water and climate crisis, they play a major role in water filtration, flood mitigation, soil stabilization, nutrient cycling, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration and habitat for a diverse range of species, and plants (including medicinal and food sources).Explore: ShallowsAGE GROUP: |\\nCambridge Art Galleries |EVENT TYPE: |\\nExhibitions + Openings |TAGS: |\\nExhibitions |\\n#Arts |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/10327485", "date": {"start": "2024-05-22T00:00:00Z", "end": "2024-05-22T23:59:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Queen's Square - Gallery IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2024-05-10T06:12:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent10265176", "eventName": "Sensory Tales", "description": "All the senses are celebrated in this inclusive sensory experience.Join us for an immersive\u00a0sensory\u00a0story time filled with adventure.AccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your needs as soon as possible so arrangements can be organized.

My first experiences with wetlands came early in life growing up on a farm near Point Pelee National Park and working in the Visitor Centre at the park for many summers. My love of these environments evolved over the years into a deeper concern for loss of these habitats and all that they support. Wetlands are unique places with environmental, spiritual, health, cultural, and social significance. They are rich biodiverse environments that team with life and provide an ever changing and evolving source of beauty. In these times of water and climate crisis, they play a major role in water filtration, flood mitigation, soil stabilization, nutrient cycling, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration and habitat for a diverse range of species, and plants (including medicinal and food sources).Explore: ShallowsAGE GROUP: |\\nCambridge Art Galleries |EVENT TYPE: |\\nExhibitions + Openings |TAGS: |\\nExhibitions |\\n#Arts |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/10327486", "date": {"start": "2024-05-23T00:00:00Z", "end": "2024-05-23T23:59:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Queen's Square - Gallery IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2024-05-10T06:12:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent10252036", "eventName": "Time for Twos and Threes", "description": "Bring your tot for some late-morning fun.

My first experiences with wetlands came early in life growing up on a farm near Point Pelee National Park and working in the Visitor Centre at the park for many summers. My love of these environments evolved over the years into a deeper concern for loss of these habitats and all that they support. Wetlands are unique places with environmental, spiritual, health, cultural, and social significance. They are rich biodiverse environments that team with life and provide an ever changing and evolving source of beauty. In these times of water and climate crisis, they play a major role in water filtration, flood mitigation, soil stabilization, nutrient cycling, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration and habitat for a diverse range of species, and plants (including medicinal and food sources).Explore: ShallowsAGE GROUP: |\\nCambridge Art Galleries |EVENT TYPE: |\\nExhibitions + Openings |TAGS: |\\nExhibitions |\\n#Arts |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/10327494", "date": {"start": "2024-06-01T00:00:00Z", "end": "2024-06-01T23:59:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Queen's Square - Gallery IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2024-05-10T06:12:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "calendarcambridgecadefaultDetail2024-06-01-0700-Cambridge-Farmers-Market", "eventName": "Cambridge Farmers' Market", "description": "The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open year round 7am-1pm.We have something for everyone!

My first experiences with wetlands came early in life growing up on a farm near Point Pelee National Park and working in the Visitor Centre at the park for many summers. My love of these environments evolved over the years into a deeper concern for loss of these habitats and all that they support. Wetlands are unique places with environmental, spiritual, health, cultural, and social significance. They are rich biodiverse environments that team with life and provide an ever changing and evolving source of beauty. In these times of water and climate crisis, they play a major role in water filtration, flood mitigation, soil stabilization, nutrient cycling, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration and habitat for a diverse range of species, and plants (including medicinal and food sources).Explore: ShallowsAGE GROUP: |\\nCambridge Art Galleries |EVENT TYPE: |\\nExhibitions + Openings |TAGS: |\\nExhibitions |\\n#Arts |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/10327500", "date": {"start": "2024-06-08T00:00:00Z", "end": "2024-06-08T23:59:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Queen's Square - Gallery IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2024-05-10T06:12:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "calendarcambridgecadefaultDetail2024-06-08-0700-Cambridge-Farmers-Market", "eventName": "Cambridge Farmers' Market", "description": "The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open year round 7am-1pm.We have something for everyone!

This event will conclude with a brief opportunity to ask questions.About the presenterAashay Dalvi, anti-racism consultant for SPECTRUM and founder of Rad Riot Books, discusses the importance of anti-colonial representation in literature. They have previously spoken about queer-affirming and anti-colonial literature at the University of Waterloo, the GSA Conference, TriPride, Kitchener Public Library, and more across Waterloo Region.Aashay\u2019s work is guided by the understanding that decolonising one\u2019s own perspective begins with seeking out and embracing voices that challenge the status quo. Frequently, narratives from queer, racialized, and non-Eurocentric immigrant voices are sidelined or misrepresented in mainstream media, despite providing invaluable insight into the larger colonial systems that perpetuate inequities within our community. Rad Riot Books was started with the purpose of challenging imperialism and settler colonialism by providing a safe space where queer and racialized newcomers as well as curious members of the community could feel empowered to explore these ideas in diverse and anti-racist book selections.AccessibilityIf you require an accessibility accommodation for this program or event, please tell us how we can meet your needs as soon as possible so arrangements can be organized.
