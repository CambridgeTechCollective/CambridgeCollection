It is where residents gather to talk about food and community happenings. It\u2019s where awareness is built and the beginnings of change takes place.The CFM dates back to the 1830s with the current market building holding its seat on Dickson Street since 1887. The presence of the market in conjunction with other civic structures, the Town Halls, is an English tradition that is as relevant today as it was when the market was built.The CFM building\u2019s continued use as a market is unique in Ontario. While other markets either remain outdoors only or have had their original buildings converted for other uses, the CFM has continued to flourish in its original location in its original building for its original intended use and this should be celebrated.As you explore the market, the sweet and spicy aromas of hot prepared foods and snacks will tempt you, along with an extensive selection of cheeses, chutneys, pies, confections, specialty oils, preserves, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.A wide range of local growers and food producers can supply you with all your needs from savoury appetizers to mouth-watering desserts.Our market wouldn\u2019t exist without those dedicated vendors, some of whom have been a part of our team for over 50 years. They arrive in the snow and in the rain, or in the heat of summer, often setting up as early as 3:30 in the morning and many don\u2019t pack up until more than 12 hours later.We have 26 year-round vendors and 30 seasonal vendors, averaging 56 vendors at the peak of the market season, who supply approximately 35,000 shopper visits each year.You can learn more about our vendors by visiting the vendor directory on our website, cambridgefarmersmarket.ca.The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open Saturdays from 7 am to 1 pm, year-round. It is located at\u00a0the corner of Ainslie Street and Dickson Street, in the heart of downtown Cambridge, and parking is available nearby.For more information, visit cambridgefarmersmarket.ca", "sourceURL": "https://calendar.cambridge.ca/default/Detail/2023-12-02-0700-Cambridge-Farmers-Market", "date": {"start": "2023-12-02T07:00:00Z", "end": "2023-12-02T13:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "40 Dickson St,", "address": "40 Dickson St,"}, "organizer": {"name": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "contact": {"email": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "phone": ""}}, "tags": ["CityCam"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-12-01T17:34:00Z", "scraperID": "Cam0002JSON"}, {"eventId": "calendarwaterlooregionmuseumcaDefaultDetail2023-12-02-0830-Pancake-Breakfast-with-Santa", "eventName": "Pancake Breakfast with Santa", "description": "Ho Ho Ho!

It is where residents gather to talk about food and community happenings. It\u2019s where awareness is built and the beginnings of change takes place.The CFM dates back to the 1830s with the current market building holding its seat on Dickson Street since 1887. The presence of the market in conjunction with other civic structures, the Town Halls, is an English tradition that is as relevant today as it was when the market was built.The CFM building\u2019s continued use as a market is unique in Ontario. While other markets either remain outdoors only or have had their original buildings converted for other uses, the CFM has continued to flourish in its original location in its original building for its original intended use and this should be celebrated.As you explore the market, the sweet and spicy aromas of hot prepared foods and snacks will tempt you, along with an extensive selection of cheeses, chutneys, pies, confections, specialty oils, preserves, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.A wide range of local growers and food producers can supply you with all your needs from savoury appetizers to mouth-watering desserts.Our market wouldn\u2019t exist without those dedicated vendors, some of whom have been a part of our team for over 50 years.

It is where residents gather to talk about food and community happenings. It\u2019s where awareness is built and the beginnings of change takes place.The CFM dates back to the 1830s with the current market building holding its seat on Dickson Street since 1887. The presence of the market in conjunction with other civic structures, the Town Halls, is an English tradition that is as relevant today as it was when the market was built.The CFM building\u2019s continued use as a market is unique in Ontario. While other markets either remain outdoors only or have had their original buildings converted for other uses, the CFM has continued to flourish in its original location in its original building for its original intended use and this should be celebrated.As you explore the market, the sweet and spicy aromas of hot prepared foods and snacks will tempt you, along with an extensive selection of cheeses, chutneys, pies, confections, specialty oils, preserves, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.A wide range of local growers and food producers can supply you with all your needs from savoury appetizers to mouth-watering desserts.Our market wouldn\u2019t exist without those dedicated vendors, some of whom have been a part of our team for over 50 years. They arrive in the snow and in the rain, or in the heat of summer, often setting up as early as 3:30 in the morning and many don\u2019t pack up until more than 12 hours later.We have 26 year-round vendors and 30 seasonal vendors, averaging 56 vendors at the peak of the market season, who supply approximately 35,000 shopper visits each year.You can learn more about our vendors by visiting the vendor directory on our website, cambridgefarmersmarket.ca.The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open Saturdays from 7 am to 1 pm, year-round. It is located at\u00a0the corner of Ainslie Street and Dickson Street, in the heart of downtown Cambridge, and parking is available nearby.For more information, visit cambridgefarmersmarket.ca", "sourceURL": "https://calendar.cambridge.ca/default/Detail/2023-12-16-0700-Cambridge-Farmers-Market", "date": {"start": "2023-12-16T07:00:00Z", "end": "2023-12-16T13:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "40 Dickson St,", "address": "40 Dickson St,"}, "organizer": {"name": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "contact": {"email": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "phone": ""}}, "tags": ["CityCam"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-12-01T17:34:00Z", "scraperID": "Cam0002JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent9491858", "eventName": "Reindeer Games", "description": "Get ready for a series of festive challenges, competitions, and crafts.Our elves have been hard at work putting together 'Minute-to-Win-It' challenges that will cause jolly laughs; Prancer has planned some sneaky scavenger hunts, and Comet has crafted glorious gift stations. \"Yule\" be sure to have a merry time!This drop-in program is a great way to get into the holiday spirit with your family.Cost: FreeAGE GROUP: |\\nKids |EVENT TYPE: |\\nPrograms + Workshops |TAGS: |\\nScavenger Hunts |\\nHolidays |\\nGames |\\nChallenges |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/9491858", "date": {"start": "2023-12-16T11:00:00Z", "end": "2023-12-16T16:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Clemens Mill - Children's Department IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-12-01T17:34:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "calendarwaterlooregionmuseumcaDefaultDetail2023-12-16-1100-SOLD-OUT-Special-Christmas-Teas-by-the-Grand-at-Mc", "eventName": "SOLD OUT - Special Christmas Teas by the Grand at McDougall Cottage", "description": "Find some time for calm this holiday season by joining us at McDougall Cottage for a jolly Christmas Tea.The Cottage will be decked out in festive style for this classic, seasonal tea that includes tasty finger sandwiches, freshly-baked scones with whipped cream and preserves, alongside some special Christmas treats and, as always, a bottomless tea pot.This would make a great gift for a friend or two - what could be better than great company, cheerful conversation and tasty holiday treats in a cozy, 165 year old stone Cottage?Reservations are required and space is limited, so reserve your spot now!Museum Members receive a 10% discount.Please note:", "sourceURL": "https://calendar.waterlooregionmuseum.ca/Default/Detail/2023-12-16-1100-SOLD-OUT-Special-Christmas-Teas-by-the-Grand-at-Mc", "date": {"start": "2023-12-16T11:00:00Z", "end": "2023-12-16T12:30:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "89 Grand Ave. S.

It is where residents gather to talk about food and community happenings. It\u2019s where awareness is built and the beginnings of change takes place.The CFM dates back to the 1830s with the current market building holding its seat on Dickson Street since 1887. The presence of the market in conjunction with other civic structures, the Town Halls, is an English tradition that is as relevant today as it was when the market was built.The CFM building\u2019s continued use as a market is unique in Ontario. While other markets either remain outdoors only or have had their original buildings converted for other uses, the CFM has continued to flourish in its original location in its original building for its original intended use and this should be celebrated.As you explore the market, the sweet and spicy aromas of hot prepared foods and snacks will tempt you, along with an extensive selection of cheeses, chutneys, pies, confections, specialty oils, preserves, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.A wide range of local growers and food producers can supply you with all your needs from savoury appetizers to mouth-watering desserts.Our market wouldn\u2019t exist without those dedicated vendors, some of whom have been a part of our team for over 50 years. They arrive in the snow and in the rain, or in the heat of summer, often setting up as early as 3:30 in the morning and many don\u2019t pack up until more than 12 hours later.We have 26 year-round vendors and 30 seasonal vendors, averaging 56 vendors at the peak of the market season, who supply approximately 35,000 shopper visits each year.You can learn more about our vendors by visiting the vendor directory on our website, cambridgefarmersmarket.ca.The Cambridge Farmers' Market is open Saturdays from 7 am to 1 pm, year-round. It is located at\u00a0the corner of Ainslie Street and Dickson Street, in the heart of downtown Cambridge, and parking is available nearby.For more information, visit cambridgefarmersmarket.ca", "sourceURL": "https://calendar.cambridge.ca/default/Detail/2023-12-23-0700-Cambridge-Farmers-Market", "date": {"start": "2023-12-23T07:00:00Z", "end": "2023-12-23T13:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "40 Dickson St,", "address": "40 Dickson St,"}, "organizer": {"name": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "contact": {"email": " farmersmarket@cambridge.ca", "phone": ""}}, "tags": ["CityCam"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-12-01T17:34:00Z", "scraperID": "Cam0002JSON"}, {"eventId": "ideaexchangelibnetinfoevent9491859", "eventName": "Reindeer Games", "description": "Get ready for a series of festive challenges, competitions, and crafts.Our elves have been hard at work putting together 'Minute-to-Win-It' challenges that will cause jolly laughs; Prancer has planned some sneaky scavenger hunts, and Comet has crafted glorious gift stations. \"Yule\" be sure to have a merry time!This drop-in program is a great way to get into the holiday spirit with your family.Cost: FreeAGE GROUP: |\\nKids |EVENT TYPE: |\\nPrograms + Workshops |TAGS: |\\nScavenger Hunts |\\nHolidays |\\nGames |\\nChallenges |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/9491859", "date": {"start": "2023-12-23T11:00:00Z", "end": "2023-12-23T16:00:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Clemens Mill - Children's Department IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-12-01T17:34:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "calendarwaterlooregionmuseumcaDefaultDetail2023-12-23-1200-Wintry-Crafternoons-at-Schneider-Haus", "eventName": "Wintry Crafternoons at Schneider Haus", "description": "The weather may be frightful, but our Wintry Crafternoons are nothing but delightful!

The installation creates a space of questioning about a reality in which displacement invokes both the fragility and the adaptability of the human being. At the intersection of art and architecture, or rather a product of their synergy, D\u00e9rives manifests as a space of freedom paving the way for limitless possibilities. This project materializes as an immersive and organically designed architectural ensemble, beckoning visitors to explore its depths and take ownership of the space itself.Conscient que le mouvement est aussi une construction de soi, Torres est attentif aux bifurcations et aux changements de direction qui fa\u00e7onnent notre mode de vie contemporain. L\u2019installations cr\u00e9ent des espaces d\u2019interrogations sur une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 dans laquelle le d\u00e9placement appelle la fragilit\u00e9 ainsi que la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019adaptation de l\u2019\u00eatre humain. \u00c0 l'intersection entre l'art et l'architecture, ou plut\u00f4t produit de leur synergie, D\u00e9rives se manifeste comme un espace de libert\u00e9 o\u00f9 tous les \u00e9changes sont possibles. Le projet est un ensemble sculptural organique et immersif en qu\u00eate d\u2019exploration, jouant avec le rapport d\u2019\u00e9chelle en fonction de l\u2019appropriation qu\u2019en fait le visiteur.Explore D\u00e9rivesAGE GROUP: |\\nCambridge Art Galleries |EVENT TYPE: |\\nExhibitions + Openings |TAGS: |\\nsculpture |\\nExhibitions |\\narchitecture |\\n#Arts |", "sourceURL": "https://ideaexchange.libnet.info/event/9579939", "date": {"start": "2023-12-31T00:00:00Z", "end": "2023-12-31T23:59:00Z"}, "location": {"name": "Preston - Gallery IdeaExchange", "address": ""}, "organizer": {"name": "IdeaExchange", "contact": {"email": "", "phone": "519-621-0460"}}, "tags": ["IdeaExchange"], "ticketInfo": {"isFree": true, "price": null, "registrationLink": ""}, "additionalInfo": "", "dateUpdate": "2023-12-01T17:34:00Z", "scraperID": "IdeaExchange0001JSON"}, {"eventId": "calendarwaterlooregionmuseumcaDefaultDetail2023-12-31-1200-Wintry-Crafternoons-at-Schneider-Haus", "eventName": "Wintry Crafternoons at Schneider Haus", "description": "The weather may be frightful, but our Wintry Crafternoons are nothing but delightful!
