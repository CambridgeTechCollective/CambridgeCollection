Companion robots are intelligent and autonomous robots that are able to assist people with needs such as performing useful tasks, but are doing so in a manner that is socially acceptable and trustworthy.

In a city bustling with newly minted millionaires and scheming upstarts, two very different women hope to change their fortunes: Gemma, a golden-haired, silver-voiced soprano whose career desperately needs rekindling, and Suling, a petite and resolute Chinatown embroideress who is determined to escape an arranged marriage. Their paths cross when they are drawn into the orbit of Henry Thornton, a charming railroad magnate whose extraordinary collection of Chinese antiques includes the fabled Phoenix Crown, a legendary relic of Beijing\u2019s fallen Summer Palace.His patronage offers Gemma and Suling the chance of a lifetime, but their lives are thrown into turmoil when a devastating earthquake rips San Francisco apart and Thornton disappears, leaving behind a mystery reaching further than anyone could have imagined... until the Phoenix Crown reappears five years later at a sumptuous Paris costume ball, drawing Gemma and Suling together in one last desperate quest for justice.Kate Quinn\u00a0is the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0and\u00a0USA Today\u00a0bestselling author of historical fiction.

All have been translated into multiple languages. She and her husband now live in California with three black rescue dogs.Born in Taiwan,\u00a0Janie Chang\u00a0has lived in the Philippines, Iran, Thailand, New Zealand, and Canada.

She has a degree in computer science and is a graduate of the Writer\u2019s Studio Program at Simon Fraser University. She is the author of\u00a0Three Souls,\u00a0Dragon Springs\u00a0Road, and\u00a0The Library of Legends.This event's moderator, Janet Somerville, taught literature for twenty years.
