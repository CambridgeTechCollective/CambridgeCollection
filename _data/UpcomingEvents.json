In a city bustling with newly minted millionaires and scheming upstarts, two very different women hope to change their fortunes: Gemma, a golden-haired, silver-voiced soprano whose career desperately needs rekindling, and Suling, a petite and resolute Chinatown embroideress who is determined to escape an arranged marriage. Their paths cross when they are drawn into the orbit of Henry Thornton, a charming railroad magnate whose extraordinary collection of Chinese antiques includes the fabled Phoenix Crown, a legendary relic of Beijing\u2019s fallen Summer Palace.His patronage offers Gemma and Suling the chance of a lifetime, but their lives are thrown into turmoil when a devastating earthquake rips San Francisco apart and Thornton disappears, leaving behind a mystery reaching further than anyone could have imagined... until the Phoenix Crown reappears five years later at a sumptuous Paris costume ball, drawing Gemma and Suling together in one last desperate quest for justice.Kate Quinn\u00a0is the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0and\u00a0USA Today\u00a0bestselling author of historical fiction. A native of Southern California, she attended Boston University, where she earned bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in classical voice. A lifelong history buff, she has written four novels in the Empress of Rome Saga and two books set in the Italian Renaissance before turning to the 20th century with\u00a0The Alice Network,\u00a0The Huntress,\u00a0The Rose Code,\u00a0and\u00a0The Diamond Eye. All have been translated into multiple languages. She and her husband now live in California with three black rescue dogs.Born in Taiwan,\u00a0Janie Chang\u00a0has lived in the Philippines, Iran, Thailand, New Zealand, and Canada. She writes historical fiction, often drawing from family history and ancestral stories. She has a degree in computer science and is a graduate of the Writer\u2019s Studio Program at Simon Fraser University. She is the author of\u00a0Three Souls,\u00a0Dragon Springs\u00a0Road, and\u00a0The Library of Legends.This event's moderator, Janet Somerville, taught literature for twenty years.

In this workshop, you\u2019ll create a vase or bowl that displays your personality and creativity through shape, colour, and decoration. Felted vessels are unique decorative pieces and can also be functional for storage and organization. This workshop is open to everyone, from the inexperienced crafter to the experienced creator and all materials are provided.About the instructors: Michael and Peter are excited to return to the Queer Craft Circle after great time last February demonstrating needle felting. They showcase their needle felted and wet felted wool creations through woolwaterneedle and are inspired by nature to create work that is decorative and allows viewers to bring their own narrative to a piece. Recently Peter has been focusing on felted paintings of farm buildings of Southwestern Ontario. Michael is often in the studio creating custom pet portraits in wool. You can learn more about woolwaterneedle by visiting their website.This program is offered in collaboration with Spectrum, Waterloo Region\u2019s Rainbow Community.

However, the extent to which these rights can reasonably be limited by law remains a subject for debate. The controversy over government attempts to regulate hate speech provides one clear example; revealing the tensions between the right to freely express oneself and the right of members of identified groups to live free from hatred and discrimination.The issue of hate speech and questions over its regulation have taken on a new urgency in recent years, especially given the growing challenge of online hate. Yet, public and media discussions on these topics often lack the historical and legal context necessary to fully understand the rise and growth of hate propaganda in Canada and the current laws that are in place to restrict hateful speech.This talk will therefore trace the history of hate movements in Canada, outline the various legal and political methods the federal government has used since the 1960s to regulate hate propaganda and ultimately consider the ways in which these histories continue to impact contemporary culture, politics, and Canadian society.About Dr. Jennifer TunnicliffeJennifer Tunnicliffe is an Assistant Professor of History at Toronto Metropolitan University. Her research focuses on Canadian and international human rights history with particular attention to how social movements shape legislative approaches to rights and freedoms. Her first book, Resisting Rights: Canada and the International Bill of Rights (UBC Press, 2019) examines Canada's resistance to the development of human rights instruments at the United Nations after the Second World War. She is also co-editor of Constant Struggle (McGill-Queen's, 2021), a collection of essays that explores Canada's history with democracy. Her current book project focuses on the history of free speech and of hate speech laws in Canada, working to situate Canada's efforts to regulate hate speech into a global perspective.About Cambridge Third Age LearningCambridge Third Age Learning (CTAL) is a movement that encourages learning and discovery experiences for those in the 'third age'.

Her work is a tactile fruit salad with a soup\u00e7on of the esoteric. Her work has been featured in publications such as: The New York Times, Harper\u2019s Bazaar Japan, Nylon Magazine and Giant Robot Magazine. She was awarded the 2020 Best of Craft and Design Award from the Toronto Outdoor Art Fair.In addition to maintaining her art practice in Guelph, Alisa also acts as a creative mentor and teacher/facilitator via various organizations including Art Not Shame. She unites her entrenchment in pop culture with her unparalleled sewing/sculpture/story-telling skills. She is inspired by other handmade items such as quilts and afghans for her, these items have a feeling of nostalgia and comfort to them. In addition, Alisa often uses recycled materials to lend to the nostalgic feel as well as fit with her philosophy of re-using what she has. https://www.alisamcronald.com/This program is offered in collaboration with Spectrum, Waterloo Region\u2019s Rainbow Community.
